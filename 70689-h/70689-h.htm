<p class="no-indent">To the world at large, Berlin Airlift headlines only highlighted
another crisis in the “cold war.” Yet behind those headlines lay an
epochal event: commercial air transports—not combat aircraft—had
become the spearhead of United States foreign policy.</p>

<p>This dramatic incident brought renewed hope to air craftsmen
who, nearly a half century earlier, had embarked on a starry-eyed
crusade to utilize the airplane for the benefit of mankind. In World
War I, they had helped smash the German Kaiser, only to find Hitler
rising phoenixlike in his boots. Two decades later, they had strafed
Hitler to earth, only to discover a colossal portrait of Joseph Stalin
looming beyond a smoke curtain. Still later, as atomic bombs and
lethal bacteria became weapons, they were asking themselves, “what
next?” when the Berlin Airlift came up with the answer: air cargo,
air commerce, air industry, air finance—air power for peace!</p>

<p>In December, 1943, we air craftsmen had our frustrations dramatized
at a banquet staged in honor of the Wright brothers on the
fortieth anniversary of Kittyhawk. Orville Wright, mouselike in a
dinner jacket and obviously uncomfortable, had sat through a barrage
of clichés microphoned by air power advocates. When finally
called on to respond, he refused point-blank. Later, in an anteroom
off the banquet hall, he gave vent to intense bitterness: evil men had
seized upon the airplane to make it the most lethal weapon in history;
he hated everything about the airplane; he rued the day he and his
brother had invented the thing.</p>

<p>We manufacturers, who had engineered their fantastic contraption
into a decisive instrument of World War II, echoed Orville
Wright’s concern. Our lives had been a kaleidoscopic drama of “the
five Ms”: men, management, money, materials, machines. Across our
stage had walked the big names of a bloody quarter century involving
two world wars. The setting had been fogged by haze from
smoke-filled Washington hotel rooms and highlighted by klieg lights
in Congressional investigating committees. Sucked by our own slipstream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
into the maelstrom of politics, we had all but lost sight of the
dim off-stage shape of One World being remorselessly forged by air
transport. Whether this should be a world of peace in our time, or
whether it must wait on centuries of slavery, would depend on what
we Americans did with the airplanes we had created.</p>

<p>Following the 1918 Armistice, we had carelessly taken a wrong
turning. After the Italian General Douhet in his book <cite>Command of
the Air</cite> had extolled the virtues of the air bombardment of civil populations,
Brig. Gen. William Mitchell raised the air power banner at
home. Later Alexander P. de Seversky, a former Russian combat
pilot, spread the Douhet gospel in a best seller, <cite>Victory Through
Airpower</cite>. When the American press followed this lead, air force in
war became the major role of the airplane.</p>

<p>This Douhet doctrine is, of course, the negation of the philosophy
expressed in the great body of international law which developed
following the Dark Ages. Chivalry, a concept devised by Christendom
to protect civilization from destruction by the Four Horsemen,
had introduced the era in which differences were resolved through
conflicts between military forces, rather than the destruction of civil
populations. Behind the morality of the principle lay the practical
consideration that it spared the conqueror the expense of rebuilding
establishments which he himself might otherwise have battered
down.</p>

<p>If Douhet, in our time, mistook air force for the foundation of
air power, our British cousins, in the Elizabethan Era, had not failed
to look at sea power through the correct end of the telescope. After
fifteenth-century geographic discoveries had placed Britain at the
crossroads of maritime commerce to America, Asia, and Africa, her
merchants and mariners recognized freedom to trade as the guarantee
of prosperity. The basic requirement for freedom to trade was a
superior fleet, utilized to guarantee, hopefully through measures
short of war, the right of all and sundry to proceed upon their lawful
occasions. Having seen the vision, the English mustered the courage
and enterprise to seize control of the sea and employ it to build Pax
Britannica, a period of spiritual as well as material progress, motivated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
by the Christian ideal, such as the world had not hitherto known.</p>

<p>In the early 1930’s, after American commercial air transport had
revealed its potentialities, we Americans likewise stood at a crossroads.
Had we but recognized our opportunity and displayed the
courage and enterprise to foster a forward-looking air policy, we
might have so directed our superior technology in the air as to match
Pax Britannica with Pax Aeronautica. History discloses that the
peaceful progress of civilization has always been paced by discoveries
in transport. Had we recognized the revolutionary character of air
transport, we might have removed enough of the causes of war to
have avoided World War II. Instead, we hamstrung our own air
power and provided our enemies with a favorable opportunity to
seize control of the air.</p>

<p>The performance of air transport in the war revealed that the air
is like an ocean that affords uninterrupted access to any spot on land
or sea. Experience proves that the airplane, contrary to widespread
belief, is inherently an economical vehicle. It demands no costly investment
in fixed rights of way; its right of way is the air, which is
free and infinitely flexible. Since the speed of the airplane permits it to
transport goods a maximum of ton-miles for a minimum of initial investment,
airline ownership of property of any kind is at a minimum.
During the thirty-year life of air-mail service, the United States Post
Office Department has recovered through sales of air-mail stamps
alone more than it has paid out to the airlines for carrying the mails.
While segments of the airline transport system have been subsidized
in the interests of national security, the system as a whole has proved
self-sustaining. The Postmaster General regards air mail not as an
expense but as an investment. He recently stated publicly, “Probably
no investment made by this government ever returned greater national
benefits in commercial and cultural progress, and national
security.”</p>

<p>It therefore seems a pity that, at the moment when providence has
placed in American hands the instrument with which to speed world
recovery, we should lack the wit to recognize the opportunity, and
the initiative, courage, and enterprise to exploit it. Where the mission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
of the Air Force is to enforce the peace, the major role of the airplane
is in air commerce, the key to world recovery. Responsibility
for utilizing air power for peace resides with the people of the United
States.</p>

<p>To air craftsmen, Orville Wright’s reaction served to emphasize
the fact that all of us had been sucked up by the slipstream of our
own propellers and whirled about like withered leaves or bits of
waste paper. Yet underneath we knew that this apparently confused
and wasteful process had accelerated progress. As engineers, we
realized that when an airplane is earthbound with its engine revving
up, the engine’s power is all wasted in noise and heat. In free flight,
on the other hand, an airscrew converts upward of 80 per cent of its
power into “effective forward thrust,” leaving but 20 per cent as
“slip.” Our slipstream is therefore an efficient machine measured by
any standard. To permit aviation to soar to new heights we must
cast off its shackles. To this end we must needs understand its fundamental
import.</p>

<p>My own thinking along this line began one November day in 1918,
while watching the vaunted German High Seas Fleet surrender to
the famed British Grand Fleet. At that time I was chief engineer of
the battleship <em>Arkansas</em>, one of five American vessels that comprised
Adm. Hugh Rodman’s Sixth Battle Squadron of Sir David Beatty’s
Grand Fleet. Beatty had a secret weapon, a force of aircraft carriers.
Some observers ascribed the German surrender to knowledge of this
fact, yet Beatty himself realized that victory had been won, not by
the ironclads which, since Jutland had not come into decisive action,
but by the battered nine-knot tramps, the doughty drifters and
trawlers, the troop-carrying liners and the wallowing tankers—merchantmen
that had been keeping the life blood coursing through
the Empire’s veins. Watching this triumph of sea power, even as the
shadow of an airplane flitted across the gun turrets of the Grand
Fleet, I had sought to draw an analogy between sea power and air
power but had dismissed the idea because there had been no such
thing then as commercial air transport.</p>

<p>The war over, Rear Adm. William Adger Moffett, founder and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
first Chief of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, called me in from
general service to specialize in aircraft engine production and, incidentally,
to lend him a hand in his fight with Brig. Gen. William
Mitchell, Assistant Chief, U.S. Army Air Service. This conflict between
belligerent giants was more than a revival of the old Army-Navy
Game. To the admiral, an inspiring leader and astute politician,
the task was to prevent Mitchell, a brilliant pilot and ardent air
enthusiast, from monopolizing all aviation—commercial, naval, and
military—under an administrative setup resembling the new British
Air Ministry. This separate and independent department, in the
opinion of the admiral, had already begun to wreck British naval
aviation and thus undermine British sea power.</p>

<p>Amid the rough and tumble of interdepartmental politics, I discovered
the fundamental precepts of aeronautic technology: the
power plant was the heart of the airplane; progress in its development
could be measured in terms of “pounds per horsepower”; the
key to technological progress was competition within the private
manufacturing and transport industries; under pressure of free competition,
the “impossible” got done today—the fantastic took a little
longer. It was no accident that the airplane had been invented in
America or that it had here attained its maximum development.
Technological leadership stemmed directly from the concept under
which our government had been created, the creative idea of the
dignity of the individual and his innate right to liberty under just
law.</p>

<p>In Washington, the struggle over the separate air force climaxed
in the summer of 1925. The big Navy rigid airship <em>Shenandoah</em>,
barnstorming over western country fairs, was destroyed in Ohio by
a line squall. General Mitchell, previously exiled to San Antonio,
Texas, seized upon the crash as a favorable moment for hurling
charges at both the Army and the Navy of their treasonable neglect
of aviation. President Calvin Coolidge, in order to sift the charges,
convened a public inquiry by a board of distinguished citizens under
the chairmanship of Dwight W. Morrow. Testifying before the
Board, Admiral Moffett took sharp issue with Mitchell on the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
of the independent air force, but took advantage of the opportunity
to outline the basis of a constructive national air policy.</p>

<p>The Morrow Board, while disapproving the Mitchell proposal for
the time being, did recommend a separate air corps status in the Army
for military aviation. It took strong exception to the idea of including
air transport in any military establishment and urged instead its
orderly development under civil authority and preferably by competitive
private industry. The Board’s recommendations were approved
by the President and transmitted to Congress where they
were quickly implemented by the Air Corps Act of 1926 and the Air
Commerce Act of the same year. These acts fixed responsibility for
aeronautic development upon the several government agencies concerned.</p>

<p>General Mitchell was convicted by an Army court-martial of
“conduct unbecoming,” but was permitted to resign. He died ten
years later, having become firmly established in the public mind as a
man of vision martyred by reactionaries. Admiral Moffett followed
up the Morrow Board findings with a recommendation for legislation
establishing a five-year development program for naval aviation.
The Army followed suit. The Post Office inaugurated contract air
mail. In the favorable climate induced by the Morrow Board policy,
American aviation attained the world leadership which it held until
after the air-mail contracts were canceled in the middle 1930’s.</p>

<p>Having become interested in naval aviation as a career, I qualified
as a naval aviator and later became Chief of Staff to Rear Adm.
Joseph M. Reeves, Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet.
There I helped commission the new aircraft carriers <em>Saratoga</em> and
<em>Lexington</em>, equipping their air squadrons with the new aircraft we
had created in the Bureau of Aeronautics. During fleet maneuvers
we developed the new tactical concept of the carrier task force, and
in January, 1929, by delivering a successful attack on the Panama
Canal from a point 150 miles at sea, we demonstrated the revolutionary
strategy of a mobile-based, long-range, naval air striking force,
the first American strategic air force. Yet while we succeeded in our
demonstration, we failed to impress upon the high command the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
revolutionary character of the idea. Twelve years later at Pearl
Harbor, the Japanese did a better job of selling. Paradoxically
enough, Admiral Reeves, as a member of the Roberts Board, went
out to Honolulu to investigate the wartime effectiveness of his peacetime
concept.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in January, 1930, I resigned from the Navy to accept
a position as chief executive of a subsidiary of the United Aircraft
and Transport Corporation, the Hamilton-Standard Propeller Corporation.
Within a year I found myself responsible for two additional
subsidiaries, Sikorsky and Chance Vought, the one a builder
of large flying boats, the other a producer of shipboard aircraft. In
private industry, I enlarged my experience in the so-called “aviation
game.”</p>

<p>When in the middle 1930’s the air-mail contracts were suddenly
canceled, American aviation received a body blow. Repercussions
from the punitive Congressional investigations sponsored by Senators
Gerald P. Nye and Hugo Black—now Mr. Justice Black of the
United States Supreme Court—interfered with both military and
commercial development and halted progress. While American aviation
was being kicked around as a political football, Messrs. Hitler,
Mussolini, Hirohito, and Stalin seized the favorable opportunity, so
unexpectedly handed them, to inaugurate their bids for world dominion
under the Douhet doctrine of victory through air force.</p>

<p>The American aircraft manufacturing industry, its domestic market
impaired by the abandonment of the Morrow Board policy, was
forced to fall back on foreign sales. For a while we existed by selling
our superior commercial air transports abroad, and in our frantic
struggle to survive, each manufacturer risked everything to develop
improved types of possible interest to our government. Early in
1939, when many companies were all but out on their feet, orders
from France and England arrived in the nick of time. It was thanks
to those orders that when the American aircraft-expansion program
was finally undertaken we were able to expand swiftly.</p>

<p>However, this shot in the arm was all but neutralized by the workings
of our own Arms Embargo Act. In order to deny France or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
England access to American arms, Hitler had only to make them
belligerents—in other words declare war on them. After he had done
so, we repealed the act, and still later President Roosevelt called for
50,000 airplanes. The first news we aircraft manufacturers had of
this decision came by way of a radio fireside chat. This released a
flood of production, the magic of which surprised us as much as anyone
else—a flood on which American air power reversed the tide
from sure defeat to certain victory.</p>

<p>Upon our entry into the war, I found myself president of United
Aircraft Corporation. In the razzle-dazzle of the wartime Washington
merry-go-round, I watched the expansion of air transport until
it became a decisive factor in the war. Hurdling the Himalayan
Hump and leapfrogging submarine-infested sea lanes, it delivered
important persons and critical cargoes to decisive points inaccessible
to other forms of transportation. Believing that this performance
presaged the advent of expanding air commerce, we manufacturers
began investing our earnings in bigger and better transports.</p>

<p>One day Navy Secretary James V. Forrestal sent for me. At the
time when some critics were still harping their cry, “too little and
too late,” he gave me private instructions to cut back production. His
problem had become “too much and too soon.” The cutback brought
us face to face with the nightmare that had haunted our dreams since
the outbreak of war. Following the Armistice of 1918, our government
had so ruthlessly canceled war contracts that the aircraft industry
had been all but destroyed. When I pointed out this danger,
the secretary suggested the only possible solution: the aircraft industry
must take its story to the public. He advised that I undertake
to lead the industry in our campaign for survival.</p>

<p>This made it necessary for me to relinquish the presidency of my
company and accept the chairmanship of the board of governors of
our trade association. The first step was to decide on an industry
policy and obtain agreement on a program. Out of the history of
aviation I drew the analogy between sea power and air power and
formulated a program of peace through air power. We took for our
objective the appointment of a new Presidential advisory commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
to hear testimony in public and recommend a new air policy revised
to conform with technological developments. As the basis for our
operations we covenanted to cooperate with one another in the public
interest in matters pertaining to policy but to continue to compete
vigorously in our business operations.</p>

<p>In an effort to crystallize aeronautic opinion, I published a book
called <cite>Air Power for Peace</cite>. This study, an objective technical
treatise, patterned on Adm. A. T. Mahan’s <cite>The Influence of Sea
Power upon History</cite>, disclosed that, despite spectacular war performances
by Army and Navy air forces, the Mahan doctrine still
prevailed: victory had again rested with those who had secured to
themselves—and denied to their enemies—freedom of communication
by sea. No overseas assault could have been mounted nor
could our own supply lines have been secured without first subduing
German submarines in the Atlantic and sweeping Japanese sea
power from the Pacific. Yet in both actions an important new
strategic factor had developed: command of the air over the sea
had become vital to command of the sea itself. It was the carrier
task forces that had proved to be the decisive instruments in both
oceans. Furthermore, brilliant, though limited, success by military
air transports had disclosed that air power was an integration of air
force, air transport, aircraft production, and in fact all that went to
make us strong in the air. Yet, until air transport could assume the
full burden of overseas trade, victory in war and prosperity in
peace must still rest with him who is strong enough—and wise
enough—to retain command of the sea. Russia’s submarine fleet
later gave added strength to this conclusion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as spokesman for the aircraft manufacturers, I addressed
organizations of all kinds, seeking to interest the molders of
public opinion in the air power problem. Our association and our
members participated in a nationwide program of public information.
The key to our effort was our endeavor to promote the public
interest as the means of serving our own enlightened self-interest.</p>

<p>Yet for all our effort, we were unable to get full cooperation from
the two other elements of integrated air power, air transport and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
armed forces. The Army Air Force, fighting for its autonomy,
tangled with naval aviation in a jurisdictional dispute. The airline
transport operators, jockeying for individual advantage under the
policy of so-called “reasonable regulation,” split wide open on such
questions as “the chosen instrument.” Government agencies, fearful
of the possible loss of their prerogatives, gave less than enthusiastic
support to our plea for a public policy-forming board. The appointment
of the commission therefore lagged, while both airline transport
and aircraft manufacturing suffered crippling losses. Convinced that
this situation called for a new book on aviation, a sort of bible of air-power,
or at least its gospel, I decided to write <em>Slipstream</em>. In December,
1946, in order to gain freedom to express my personal points of
view without compromising my company, I resigned from United
Aircraft.</p>

<p>While it was Mahan, the historian, who first revealed to the world
the decisive influence of sea power upon history, it was Richard
Hakluyt, author of <cite>The English Voyages</cite>, who inspired Englishmen
to exploit sea power to their commercial advantage. By collecting
the journals of the world’s leading merchants and the adventure
narratives of its greatest navigators, and by editing them so as both
to entertain his readers and stimulate them to seek their fortunes on
the high seas, he influenced the course of history. There are no such
journals and narratives of contemporary aviation. Although the
whole record is comprised in the lifetimes of a single generation of
still-active men so that no protracted research is needed to reveal the
intimate background, much of it already tends to become dim, even
in the minds of men who wrote the record. Unless it be set down now
it may be forever lost, and that would be a pity, for the fantastic story
holds lessons that apply equally well to other technological developments
such as atomic energy. In undertaking to set forth the intimate
narrative of events which, in the last quarter century, have helped
shape the destiny of American aviation, I am impelled to proceed
partly because of deep convictions and partly because my unusually
varied experience gives me a somewhat broader point of view from
which to judge the impact of events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span></p>

<p>While engaged on this task, I was disturbed to note that matters
were going from bad to worse. In the summer of 1948, however, help
came from an unexpected source. The Russians imposed their blockade
on Berlin. The American public, aroused now to the need for
preserving American air power, clamored for action. The Republican
Congress voted a Congressional Aviation Policy Board; President
Truman countered with his own Air Policy Commission.
Before this latter organization, known as the “Finletter Board,” the
aircraft manufacturers presented a well-prepared case. The airline
transport operators, having suffered disastrous losses, were demoralized
almost to the point where they were willing to accept a subsidy
such as that long paid to the merchant marine. The Air Force, having
earlier won its autonomy, made a vigorous plea for funds to provide
a strong strategic air force.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, the Finletter Board, whose report was
published under the title, “Survival in the Air Age,” naturally gave
priority to the military aspects of aviation. The Congressional Aviation
Policy Board supported a long list of recommendations made by
the Finletter Board and recommended legislative action, little of
which has been forthcoming. But military appropriations, easily the
immediate answer to the air power problem, were passed largely
because the public had been convinced that this country must maintain
a technically superior aircraft-manufacturing establishment
under private management. Thanks to these appropriations, the aircraft
industry has survived the ordeal of reconversion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, bureaucratic muddling had all but wrecked the airline
transport industry when, in the summer of 1949, Senator Edwin
C. Johnson of Colorado, chairman of the Senate Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee, commenced hearings to inquire into
its ills. Out of the welter of testimony before this committee—evidence
replete with inconsistencies and strongly flavored by self-interest—someone
familiar with the intimate history of aviation
could crystallize his convictions as to what must be done to make
American air power a force for peace. Believing that these convictions
should be expressed, even though they might prove distasteful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
to some of the customers of the aircraft manufacturers, and desiring
to avoid embarrassment to my former associates, I resigned the
chairmanship of the board of governors of the Aircraft Industries
Association and severed my last connection with the industry. Now,
I should at least be able to view the whole subject of air power objectively.</p>

<p>Out of the twisting and turning of our slipstream, air policy is
revealed, not as so many believe, as a code book of detailed administrative
procedures, but as a course of public conduct. It is no technical
complexity of materials, money, management, or machines, but
rather a simple expression of the spirit of men, one that can be stated
in words of one syllable, “Air Power For Peace.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">It was a day in March of 1924 when I first stepped across the threshold
of the anteroom to the office of Rear Adm. William Adger Moffett,
Chief of the new Bureau of Aeronautics in the Navy Department
at Washington. The anteroom lay at the center of the extreme
after end of the top deck of the third wing of the temporary frame
structure which then housed, and in fact still houses, the Navy Department.
Through the windows I could see the greening lawns of
the Mall and the budding cherry blossoms along the rim of the Tidal
Basin. Directly below, the Reflecting Pool, a square-cut sapphire,
mirrored the tip of the Washington Monument and the cottony
clouds of a blustery day. I handed my orders to the admiral’s secretary
and, as she disappeared through a door to the left, I glanced
around.</p>

<p>To the right of the secretary’s desk, a latticed, swinging half door
of the type once common to saloons of the preprohibition era bore a
gilt-lettered sign reading “Assistant Chief of Bureau.” To the left,
on a similar door, the letters spelled “Chief of Bureau.” As it swung
open, the secretary waved me toward a stiff-backed chair and said,
“The admiral will see you in a few minutes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lifting my sword off its hook, I stripped the white lisle gloves
from my hands, dusted a bit of lint off my two and a half gilt stripes,
and sat down in the chair. Most young officers bearing such orders
as mine would have thrilled at the thought of duty in Washington,
but I was vaguely uneasy. That sword, standing on the tip of its
scabbard between my knees, seemed, in a way, to point up my doubts.
Forged into its blade was a quotation from one of Teddy Roosevelt’s
slogans, “The only shots that count are the shots that hit.”
Judged by that standard, I had not scored too well since graduation
from Annapolis in 1908. Having set out on a career in gunnery, I had
let myself be diverted from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>I had been appointed to the Naval Academy from the state of
Washington and had been admitted at the age of sixteen. Having
grown up in the Pacific Northwest, where I enjoyed the great outdoors,
hunting and fishing with my father, I had drifted onto the
Naval Academy rifle team, where I found fun in competition that
made a sport out of a branch of my profession. Rifle shooting had
intensified my interest in gunnery and had helped me to win my
sword. The opposite side of its blade carried the words, “Class of
1871 prize for excellence in practical and theoretical ordnance and
gunnery.” It was out of this background that I had determined to
specialize in gunnery, but circumstances had deflected me into engineering.</p>

<p>After the close of the national rifle matches at Camp Perry in
1909, during which the Navy rifle team had won the military championship,
I had been assigned to duty on a four-piper, a coal-burning
torpedo-boat destroyer, the <em>Hull</em>, then attached to the Pacific Torpedo
Flotilla based on San Diego, California. Just before I had
reported to the ship, there had been an accident to one of the boilers;
and since, up to that time, it had not been customary to assign officers
to the engine room of destroyers, the subsequent court of inquiry
had not been able to hang an officer for the explosion. Until the
case could be reported as completed, the Navy Department could
find no way to close its file, thus leaving an annoying piece of unfinished
business. To guard against future lapses of this kind, someone
had to be made Chief Engineer, and since I, a passed midshipman,
was the junior officer aboard the <em>Hull</em>, I was handed the accolade.</p>

<p>Early in 1911, my Annapolis June Week Girl, Genevieve Speer,
and I had been married at her home in Joliet, Illinois. We had later
commuted between the Hotel del Coronado and less commodious
accommodations in the Navy Yard town of Vallejo, California, until
the summer of 1913, when we had been ordered back to our beloved
Annapolis for duty, in compliance with my request for instruction
in the new postgraduate engineering school, which had
just been opened. The course included a year at Annapolis and
another in New York at Columbia University, and was directed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Dr. Charles Edward Lucke, Dean of Mechanical Engineering and
a pioneer in his profession.</p>

<p>Dr. Lucke, who had just published his monumental work <cite>Engineering
Thermodynamics</cite>, found his Navy charges none too susceptible
to his teaching techniques. Finally one day he discovered
the reason; we were, to use his expression, “an aggregation of photographic
memorizers.” And so far as I was concerned he was probably
right—to win my sword I had memorized all the textbooks on
ordnance and gunnery. The doctor had now to start from scratch
to teach us “to reason from a set of facts to a logical solution.”</p>

<p>This was an era in which college professors made a mystery of
science; it gave them a feeling of superiority over the practical man.
The latter similarly looked down their noses at the theorists. The
term “engineer” was used to designate the driver of a railway locomotive
or, in New York City, the superintendent of an apartment
house. Dr. Lucke was of the opinion that, if the time ever came when
the practical man and the theorist combined their talents as professional
engineers, they would set the world on fire.</p>

<p>“As engineers,” he stated for the opening gun of his new approach,
“we deal with the application of combustion to industrial purposes.”</p>

<p>And having thus stated the role of the engineer he went on to
develop the fundamental requirements for combustion:</p>

<p>“The fuel and oxygen,” he advised, “must be present in the proportions
necessary to chemical combination; they must be intimately
mixed; they must be brought to the ignition temperature and retained
there until combustion is complete.”</p>

<p>And having expounded this truth he went on into one of his excursions
into philosophy:</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “might be taken as a prescription for life. And
remember,” he warned, “that whereas material things respond always
in the same way to the same stimuli, that is not true of the
human spirit. As engineers you will deal quite as frequently with
the spiritual as with the material and must understand both.”</p>

<p>The doctor, who exercised a strong influence on some of us,
inspired us to do creative work. My first opportunity came shortly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
after graduation from Columbia in 1915, with my assignment as
Chief Engineer of the battleship <em>Arkansas</em>. The “<em>Old Ark</em>” had been
commissioned three years earlier with Comdr. William Adger Moffett
as her Executive Officer, and still retained the marks of his
leadership. In fleet athletics and in the gunnery competitions she had
won honors. In engineering, however, she had, like other ships with
the new turbines then replacing reciprocating engines, earned a
reputation as a “coal hog.” To overcome this, I had worked out a
scheme for using the waste heat of auxiliary exhaust steam for distilling
sea water, thus saving about one-third of the daily port consumption.
For this development I had narrowly escaped being
disciplined because I had not previously obtained permission from
the Bureau of Engineering.</p>

<p>After our entry into World War I, the <em>Arkansas</em> was assigned
to the Sixth Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet and had
been present at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet. It was
there, on the afternoon of November 21, 1918, that the shadow of
the airplane had first fallen across my path.</p>

<p>The Sixth Battle Squadron had returned to its anchorage east of
the great Forth Bridge. Adm. Sir David Beatty, Commander in Chief
of the Grand Fleet, on his flagship <em>Queen Elizabeth</em>, had swept
through the American Squadron. And as the “<em>Q.E.</em>” passed us,
so close aboard that one could have heaved a spud onto her decks,
Beatty had stood on his bridge, gold-visored cap cocked over his
right eye, bulldog chin jutting out over the bridge screen, hand raised
to his visor in acknowledgment of our cheers. As these died away,
<em>Q.E.</em>’s searchlights had begun flashing a bridge signal that burned
itself on my memory:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p class="no-indent">FROM: COMMANDER IN CHIEF GRAND FLEET</p>

<p class="no-indent">TO: BRITISH EMPIRE</p>

<p class="no-indent">BRITAIN HAS THIS DAY WITNESSED A DEMONSTRATION OF SEA
POWER WHICH SHE WILL FORGET AT HER PERIL</p>
</div>

<p>Then as the flagship had slid by, her turrets topped by fighter
aircraft poised for take-off, she had uncovered to our view the loom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of a hulk lying down toward May Island. It was the aircraft carrier
<em>Argus</em>, latest addition to the world’s one and only carrier force.
And I had thought that, even as British sea power had triumphed,
the shadow of air power was darkening the fleet.</p>

<p>I had learned details of the <em>Argus</em> from an enthusiastic naval aviator,
Godfrey de Courcelles de Chevalier, class of 1909, one of our
big boat pilots from the Northern Bombing Base, who, detailed to
observe carrier operations, had been billeted on the <em>Ark</em>. The British
Admiralty, fearful lest the Hun decoy Beatty into the Skagerrak
and hit him below the armor belt with torpedoes carried by shore-based
aircraft, had mounted fighters on every available ship, and had
augmented this defense with aircraft carriers. Most of these had been
converted from old battle cruisers and, like other vessels, could only
launch aircraft. Their fighting planes were expected to return to
prepared air fields on shore, such as the Grand Fleet base at Turnhouse,
whence they would be lightered off to their vessels.</p>

<p>But the <em>Argus</em>, originally built for the Italian Line as the <em>Conte de
Savoia</em>, had been the first flattop capable of receiving aircraft aboard
as well as launching them. And she had carried torpedoplanes with
which to hit the Hun below his own belt. This force had been
Beatty’s “secret weapon,” and, some thought, had helped persuade
the Hun to surrender without firing a shot.</p>

<p>After the German surrender, the <em>Ark</em> had been ordered home, and
I had been assigned to the Naval Training Station, Great Lakes,
Illinois, as Officer in Charge, Aviation Mechanics Schools. Here
again I was to encounter Dr. Lucke and Capt. William Adger Moffett.
During the war, Captain Moffett had commanded the training
station and used it to show the Navy’s colors to the Middle West.
One of those rare personalities, a naval officer with a flair for public
relations, he had made many friends on the North Shore, but after the
Armistice, was sent to the Pacific in command of the <em>Mississippi</em>,
one of the few battleships with an airplane catapult aboard. Dr. Lucke
had offered his services to the Navy upon the outbreak of the war
and had established a chain of aviation mechanics schools, operated
on the new principle of line production in education. One of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
had been located at Great Lakes and, at the end of the war, Captain
Moffett had succeeded in consolidating them all there.</p>

<p>When, after the Armistice, Dr. Lucke had sought a regular officer
as his relief, he had recommended me to the Navy Department. I
had accepted the appointment with enthusiasm because the station
was near my wife’s former home in Joliet. After we had been there
on duty a year or so, Captain Moffett had returned for a visit with
his friends and had surprised me one morning by calling on me in
my office.</p>

<p>He had completed his tour of duty at sea and was headed for Washington
on a new project. As Captain of the <em>Mississippi</em>, he had been
hampered in his catapult work by the lack of direction in Washington.
Aviation activities were scattered all over the Department:
engines in the Bureau of Engineering; airplanes in the Bureau of
Construction and Repair; guns in the Bureau of Ordnance; and
Operations in a branch of the Office of Naval Operations. Moffett
had decided to go before Congress with a proposal to create a new
Bureau of Aeronautics in the Navy Department and expected to
be made its first Chief.</p>

<p>And that morning at Great Lakes he had asked me point-blank
if I would accept duty in his new bureau in charge of the Engine
Section. I had first shied away from the idea, but he brushed my
objection aside. He would have me ordered to sea duty in aviation,
he said, and then bring me ashore to his bureau. Accordingly, in
1921 I was ordered to New York to put the seaplane tender and
kite-balloon ship <em>Wright</em> into commission, with duty as Chief Engineer,
a job which had turned out to be that of wet nurse for a
lot of dizzy, heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air pilots. As a “Kiwi,”
the current name for a nonflying officer, I had found my young
charges willing to concede me all the responsibilities of the organization,
provided no one interfered with their authorities.</p>

<p>Our first “cruise,” nominally to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, strewed
aircraft all along the Atlantic Coast after forced landings, with dense
concentrations at Palm Beach. All failures in this outfit were
classified as “mechanical”; the term “cockpit failure” had not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
been created. On analysis, I had discovered that practically all forced
landings and delayed starts were chargeable to a few pilots. But when
I posted the figures on the wardroom bulletin board, this act had
been considered hardly cricket. Fed up with the vagaries of this
school of aviation thought, I had looked around for a change of duty,
and found it during the summer of 1922.</p>

<p>That year, the National Rifle Association of America had decided
to enter a team in the international free rifle matches at Milan,
Italy, and extended me an invitation to compete for the squad. Here
was an opportunity to escape the razzle-dazzle of naval aviation into
something I knew about. Better still, it afforded an opportunity for
my wife and me to make a joint European tour. At Milan, our team
won the championship of the world. By that time, my wife had obtained
tickets to the last performance of the Passion Play at Oberammergau,
an event destined to shape my outlook.</p>

<p>We had been billeted in the home of Antone Lang, the Christus
of the play, and had been stirred by the devout spirit shining in the
faces of the villagers. The play, too, had moved us deeply as a revelation
of the fundamental tenets of our Christian faith. Though spoken
wholly in German it had remained for us a vital religious experience.</p>

<p>During the evening following the performance we had talked
with Antone Lang in his parlor and obtained his autograph on a
photograph of himself in his role. And when we had come to settle
with Frau Lang for our lodgings, we had been astonished to find
them so absurdly cheap. Upon our offer to contribute to a local
charity—this at a time when inflation had put the exchange rate up
to several thousand marks to the dollar—Frau Lang had set a limit of
twenty-five marks. At my exclamation of surprise she had hurried
to explain, “We need honest work, not charity. Today there is
nothing that money can buy!” I had left with a deep impression of
the disaster of inflation and the folly of war.</p>

<p>Upon our return from Europe, I had avoided the Bureau of
Aeronautics and obtained an assignment as Executive Officer of the
destroyer tender <em>Bridgeport</em>, a converted former German merchantman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Under command of Capt. R. Drace White, I had enjoyed
a year and a half of pleasant duty, trying to make a yacht out of a
floating machine shop, and had just begun to feel at ease, when
Adm. William Adger Moffett reached down into the Caribbean to
pluck me off my happy home and install me in his bureau.</p>

<p>Thus it had been that, thanks to Dr. Lucke and the admiral, I
was diverted from gunnery into engineering and then into aviation.
Now as a buzzer sounded, and the admiral’s secretary smiled her
signal to enter the sanctum, I hooked on my sword and pushed open
the door, not with the enthusiasm of an aviator but with the reservations
of the professional seaman.</p>

<p>Inside his sunny corner office, Admiral Moffett leaned against the
old-fashioned high desk at which he stood when signing out papers.
That desk, I thought, was a relic of the days of high stools and celluloid
eyeshades, and must have been dragged out from some old
storeroom by the admiral for the sake of sentiment. He was like that,
a curious mixture of sentimental attachment to the days of sail and
nervous enthusiasm for the airplane. Over his shoulder draped the
silk cord of a pince-nez, poised on the bridge of his nose. His double-breasted
blue-serge civilian suit, cut to look like the new uniforms,
bespoke revolt against the executive order which had instructed
officers on duty in Washington to stow their regimentals away with
moth balls in sea chests.</p>

<p>This order was a manifestation of the “return to normalcy,” under
which slogan, Senator Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge
were to be sledded into the White House and the Vice-Presidency
later the same year. For the American people, disillusioned after
their recent crusade to make the world safe for democracy, had now
turned their backs on Europe to devote themselves to something
they knew more about—how to make money fast. During the existing
reaction against all things military, the Administration deemed
it wise to keep uniforms out of sight as far as possible. They were
only permitted to be worn by officers reporting for duty, as I was
at that moment.</p>

<p>The admiral turned to shake hands with me and hand me my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
signed orders. His was the aristocratic bearing of the Southern cavalier.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you aboard,” he greeted me warmly. “You are to
relieve Lt. Comdr. B. G. Leighton as Chief of the Engine Section—an
important department. I’m sure you’ll do well at it.” His was
the accent of Charleston, South Carolina, but without the drawl. He
clipped his words like a nervous Yankee.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” I replied, acknowledging the order in the conventional
manner, “but what I don’t know about aircraft engines,”
I added, “would overflow the library of Congress.”</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned the admiral, “you have one advantage—you
know you don’t know anything, which is more than I can say for
some people in this Department.” He reached for his pipe and
struck a match. (I was to learn that he smoked more matches than
tobacco.) As the pipe went out he glanced at me.</p>

<p>“Leighton tells me you are not too happy about coming here for
duty.”</p>

<p>“It breaks my sea cruise,” I explained, “and I don’t like to give
the Selection Board an excuse to pass me over.”</p>

<p>“The last Board picked you up,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And a year ahead of time,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am not supposed to discuss the proceedings of the Board,” he
continued, “but I was a member of it and, confidentially, I served
notice on them that I would not approve a list that failed to reach
down through you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“I needed you here, and you can depend on me to look out for
you in the future.” He fumbled with his pipe.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot going on around Washington,” he volunteered.
“That fellow Billy Mitchell over in the Army Air Service makes
a lot of trouble for me. But back in ’twenty-two at the Limitation of
Arms Conference I set him back on his heels. He tried to take over
the chairmanship of the session on aviation, and the first subject on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the agenda was reparations. This country was scheduled to get one of
the latest German Zeppelins, converted to a merchantman, and I
didn’t intend to let the Army beat me to that punch.” He paused to
glance at a silvery model of a rigid airship, standing on top of his
cluttered desk.</p>

<p>“And so,” he went on, “when Mitchell breezed in with a secretary,
all ready to take the chair, I inquired by what authority he pretended
to assume the chairmanship. He mumbled something about rank.
‘Since when,’ I demanded, ‘does a one-star brigadier rate a two-star
admiral?’ That stopped him, and the Navy got the <em>Los Angeles</em>.”</p>

<p>He moved close to me, tapping me on the forearm with his pipestem.
“It isn’t just the old Army-Navy dogfight, though of course
there is a lot of that in it. But these overzealous knights of the air
actually believe that the airplane has already obsoleted the Navy. It
isn’t their own idea but the nonsense preached by that Italian General
Douhet in a book called <cite>Command of the Air</cite>. And on his say-so,
these wild-eyed enthusiasts want to scrap the Army and Navy, on no
other grounds than their personal opinions, unsupported by experience
or fact.” He paused.</p>

<p>“And the old fogies over in Operations are no help to me, either,”
he added. “They lay themselves wide open to Mitchell. If they
had let me handle the publicity on the bombing off the Virginia
Capes, I could have made a monkey out of him.” He began pacing the
room.</p>

<p>“If the Navy doesn’t hurry and build up its own air force,” he
rattled on, “it <em>will</em> be obsolete, just as Mitchell claims. Without an
air force, the fleet would be a sitting duck. Mitchell knows that,
and his game is to concentrate all aviation in a separate and independent
air force under his command. With that setup he can emasculate
naval aviation just like the British Air Ministry is doing in England.
Meanwhile I am taking advantage of that to catch up with our
own carriers. Give me a little time and we’ll leave them in the ruck.”
A flush had crept up around his ears.</p>

<p>“So that’s why I had to create this Bureau—and why I had you
ordered here. We’ve got a fight on our hands to keep Mitchell from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
sinking the Navy, and the country along with it.” He paused to
cock his eye at me.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “if you don’t like a nice knockdown, drag-out
fight, I can send you back to General Service.”</p>

<p>My thoughts flashed back to my last night aboard the old <em>Bridgeport</em>,
a Caribbean night beneath the stars when the crew had given
me a farewell “happy hour.” Floodlights had glowed on the boxing
ring, rigged on Number Three hatch. Brown-faced, white-shirted
sailormen had looked up at the two gloved lads in boxing trunks
whom the referee had called to the center of the ring for final instructions.
And then as he had sent them back to their comers with
a slap on each back he called after them, “Remember, now: break
clean and come up fightin’. It’s anybody’s fight.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWO">CHAPTER TWO<br>
The Power Plant, the Heart of an Airplane</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Down on the second deck of the third wing, I looked through
the doorway into a long room that housed my new billet, the Engine
Section. Three flat-topped desks stood deployed as a line of
skirmishers; two typewriter desks closed the blank files. At these
desks secretaries had begun to tap out their daily stints of paper
work. Around three of the peeled walls, battered tables sagged under
a load of assorted aircraft-engine parts—dusty, oily, and, for the
most part, heat-blackened examples of unfortunate mechanical failures,
some of which, no doubt, had led to loss of life.</p>

<p>Across the near side of the room, on either side of two doors, stood
three engines on wooden horses. The bigger one was a Liberty, the
smaller a Hispano-Suiza, and the third a new star-shaped contraption
on which hung a label, “Lawrance J-1, single-row, air-cooled
radial.” The first two I recognized as war surplus, but the third I
suspected to be the pride and joy, the hope and fear, of the Engine
Section of BUAERO. Here was the Navy’s first promising postwar
development, a project destined to exercise a controlling influence
on the future of aviation.</p>

<p>Around the room, marred woodwork and grease-spotted floors
joined with a musty smell to give the room the down-at-the-heel appearance
of all those temporary wartime structures, themselves so
expressive of the popular hope that war itself is but temporary.
Drab enough at best, the old tenements had deteriorated swiftly with
the slashing of appropriations for defense. Now as I stood in the
doorway, someone slapped me on the back and I turned to find
Lt. Comdr. B. G. Leighton, retiring Chief of the Section, greeting
me like a long-lost brother.</p>

<p>“Am I glad to see you,” he whooped, saluting me with an exaggerated
flourish. Under his enthusiasm the drabness faded out like
a morning fog under a warm sun. Waving an airy hand at each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
his secretaries, Leighton introduced me to them with, “Ladies, meet
your new boss.”</p>

<p>Tossing an armful of homework on the right-hand desk, and waving
me to a battered chair, he slid into a swivel-seated one behind it.
There he sat grinning like an ape, peering at me around three mountains
of paper work heaped up in trays marked, “Incoming,” “Outgoing,”
and “Hold.” Though still in his early thirties, Leighton had
gray splashes around his temples with laugh wrinkles twinkling at
the corners of his eyes—those early-bird aviators tended toward
premature grayness. Now, clasping his hands behind his head and
hoisting long legs so as to rest his feet on the battered old desk, he
grinned his pleasure.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen,” he quoted, “but now that
I’ve finally got you here, I hardly know where to begin.”</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning,” I countered. “It’s all Greek to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, in the beginning of power-driven flight,” he commenced,
“before the Wrights could take the hurdle from the glider to the
airplane, they had first to find an engine whose weight was light
enough, in proportion to its power, to get the contraption into the air.
And since nothing suitable existed, they had to design and build their
own. Thus from the beginning,” he went on, “the power plant has
been the heart of the airplane. Subsequent progress has been almost
entirely a matter of getting more horsepower for less weight. When
you want to lift yourself up by the bootstraps,” he added with a
grin, “you start reducing, and begin exercising your muscles. The
history of aviation can be measured by that ratio, pounds per horsepower.”</p>

<p>At the turn of the century, Leighton pointed out, gasoline engines
were just coming into use. The Wrights, in designing their
little 20-hp 4-cylinder model, had naturally followed the current
automotive practice. They had arranged the cylinders in line and
had cooled the engine with circulating water.</p>

<p>“It is only now,” Leighton explained, waving a hand in the direction
of the Lawrance air-cooled radial near the door, “that we are
spreading our cylinders like the petals of a daisy and cooling them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
directly by air. And this section,” he added with obvious pride, “is
the foster parent of an innovation but recently classified by the
engineering intelligentsia as ‘impossible.’ As for that obsolete term,”
he went on, “we have a saying in the Section that goes like this:
‘The impossible we do today; the fantastic may take a little longer.’”
He grinned as he watched me for the effect of another one of his
phrases.</p>

<p>Leighton went on to point out, however, that back in 1914, the
year the war broke out in Europe, this country had practically no
military aircraft engines. The Wrights had not thought of the airplane
as a weapon carrier. Over in Europe, however, where men
had long been accustomed to look at things through military binoculars,
the Germans, the French, the Italians, and the British had concentrated
on military power plants. In the commercial field, the
United States had a fair-to-middling engine in the Curtiss OXX, rated
at less than 90 horsepower. This one later went into wide war use
in the Curtiss Jenny training planes. But when, in April, 1917, the
war had engulfed the United States, it caught us with our britches
down around our ankles. We had no high-powered military engines
of any kind, nor had we any designs for them. And even had we
had the designs, there were no production facilities in this country
nor the know-how for using them.</p>

<p>Quite undismayed by this, we had indulged in our usual penchant
for adopting slogans as substitutes for elementary strategy. Our politicians
boldly declared their intent to “darken the skies over Germany
with clouds of aircraft.” The headline figure had been 25,000
planes. But if anyone had any idea what we expected to do with
them, other than darkening the skies, such information had been kept
secret. There was a suspicion in some quarters that our bold brag
had been designed to screen the simple citizens from the unhappy
fact that we had no power plants with which to fly those clouds into
the air.</p>

<p>That had been a period of childlike faith in the magic of mass
production. Then the government, in a frantic effort to buy time, had
called in the automotive industry. A handful of citizens, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
heads contained all that was known in this country about high-powered
engines of any kind, had been locked in a smoke-filled room
of the Willard Hotel in Washington, and there held incommunicado,
until they gave birth to the Liberty engine.</p>

<p>The Liberty, conceived in a crisis, and literally bulldozed into
production, had proved surprisingly effective in postwar flying,
especially after the usual bugs had been engineered out of it. Actually,
few if any engines had been used in front-line combat. Yet,
keeping in mind the fact that we had only remained in the war twenty
months, and that it usually takes at least two years to construct and
test an experimental model, the production of several thousand engines
had been little less than magic.</p>

<p>The Liberty had been rated at 400 horsepower on a dry weight
of some 835 pounds, or at the rate of a little over 2 pounds per horsepower,
a striking advance over contemporary practice. And although
under the interallied agreement, we had been denied the right to
build front-line planes of our own design, we had installed the
Liberty in the British de Havilland observation plane and made quite
a job out of it. Dubbed “flying coffins” until after correction of the
bugs, these had passed through the initial stage of unpopularity, to
become “the good old DH,” and pretty much the standard for “cross-country”
airplanes.</p>

<p>But during the war, failure by the automotive industry to meet
the fantastic goals set by politicians had aroused a storm of criticism
in the United States. Hardly had the ink dried on the Armistice
before the government, convinced that “munitions racketeers” had
profited out of the war, had turned its wrath upon “malefactors of
great wealth” by ruthlessly canceling war contracts, with little regard
for its contractural obligations. Having now made the world
safe for democracy, it felt at liberty to destroy its expensive and unnecessary
war industry, venting its spite meanwhile on the industrialists.</p>

<p>Manufacturers, who before final accounting had anticipated profits,
now found themselves facing losses instead. Some, the less well-financed,
had gone into bankruptcy; others had reorganized and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
kept in business. Overall, it was estimated that representative suppliers
of war goods had taken a write-down of nearly a billion dollars,
or about one-half their “apparent” net worth. The automotive
industry, licking its wounds, had gone back to do private business
with its individual customers, resolved to leave future government
business to the naïve.</p>

<p>Judged in retrospect, the venture had proved a fiasco. It would
have been bad enough had industry earned its reputation for profiteering,
but to have gained the reputation after losing its shirt must
be counted a public-relations failure of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the giant aircraft industry had just withered on the
vine. A handful of the hardier “old-line” aircraft manufacturers,
pioneers still obsessed by undiminished zeal for aviation, still held
on. Among such engine builders had been the Curtiss Airplane and
Motor Company, of Buffalo, New York, and the Wright Martin
Aircraft Corporation, of New Brunswick, New Jersey, now reorganized
as the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, of Paterson, New
Jersey. Of the automotive industry, Packard alone kept a finger in
the pie.</p>

<p>During the war, Wright Martin had followed the other alternative
to engine construction; they had bought a license to manufacture
the famed French Hispano-Suiza engine. And although this procedure
had been advanced as promising quicker returns, wartime
experience had developed the complexities of putting foreign models
into production. Designed around the European idea of handwork
by skilled craftsmen, they had to be redesigned to conform to the
American technique of machine-tool production. And so experience
had demonstrated the necessity for having domestic types in production
and ready for expansion.</p>

<p>After the Armistice, the new Wright Aeronautical Corporation
continued to develop the Hispano type, under the aegis of the Navy
Department. Using the method of “run’em, bust’em, fix’em, and
run’em again,” financed by the Engine Section, Wright had developed
its temperamental wartime Hispano into a rugged, 200-hp
Model E-4. Wright had also developed a 300-and later a 500-hp-model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Hispano, but since Congress had appropriated limited funds,
and on a hand-to-mouth basis rather than for a long-term program,
they had found the going rough. As long as the surplus of wartime
Liberties and Hispanos hung over the market, manufacture bogged
down.</p>

<p>And to add a further complication, Leighton had shown a lively
interest in the new air-cooled engine developed by Charles Lanier
Lawrance. Charlie, while a student in Paris, had discovered the new
3-cylinder 60-hp Clerget, a fixed radial engine designed to overcome
the deficiencies of the old Gnome-Rhone types with their
rotating cylinders and gyroscopic effects. The Navy had at that
time a demand for 180- to 200-hp engines, and suggested that
Lawrance consolidate three of the 3-cylinder engines into a single
9-cylinder type.</p>

<p>Lawrance, with no production facilities of his own, had enlisted
those of the de la Verne Machine Company, in New Jersey, and
had begun his own development under the “run’em and bust’em”
technique. In this he had looked for guidance to Capt. A. K. Atkins
and Lt. Comdr. S. M. Kraus, of the Bureau of Engineering. When,
later, Admiral Moffett created BUAERO, he placed Kraus in charge
of Procurement and assigned Leighton as Chief of the Engine Section.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Chance Vought, a clever airplane manufacturer in
Long Island City, had built a smart little, two-seater, catapult-observation
plane around the new engine, a craft that carried as much
load as the Army DH using the Liberty engine, yet took up half as
much space. And space was a critical factor within the narrow confines
of a battleship or a cruiser’s decks.</p>

<p>With this increased demand, the Bureau was confronted with the
need for bringing in an experienced aircraft manufacturer to fabricate
the Lawrance engines, and had selected Wright. But since
the new Lawrance was a direct competitor with Wright’s own
Hispano E-4, Leighton had been obliged to bring pressure to bear
and had finally forced consolidation of what he deemed the best
design with what he considered the ablest manufacturer. Wright’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
purchase of Lawrance had but recently taken place and I was to have
the job of making the marriage productive. This, according to
Leighton, was the big project of the Engine Section, if not, indeed,
of BUAERO.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he discussed other assorted possibilities, like the Aeromarine
Airplane and Motor Corporation, of Keyport, New Jersey,
and the Kinney Manufacturing Company, in Boston. Of the automotive
people, only Packard retained an interest in aero engines.
Leighton admitted that mine was a slender reed on which to lean.
“The heart of the airplane,” he summed up, “has damaged muscles
and leaky valves.” I concluded that it would have ceased beating entirely
save for the grim courage of B. G. Leighton and his Engine
Section.</p>

<p>“The air-cooled engine,” Leighton asserted, “is the Navy’s white
hope. There is less sense in liquid-cooling an aircraft engine than
in air-cooling a submarine. The weight of the Liberty radiator, water
pump, plumbing, and water runs about three-quarters of a pound per
horsepower, or say 300 pounds. Now there’s an old design adage that
says ‘it takes a pound to carry a pound.’ In other words, each of
those plumbing pounds takes another pound of wings and tail to
lug it around. But with the air-cooled engine we can throw away the
plumbing and convert that dead weight into pay load, with a smaller
airplane. On board ship, you’ve got to keep ’em small or leave ’em
off.”</p>

<p>By the end of my first day in the Engine Section, I was a bit groggy.
Leighton had tossed engineering terms around with complete abandon,
terms that I must pause to translate, even as he moved on into
new flights of technical verbiage. Yet from that first day’s talk I
gleaned the fact that the power plant is the heart of an airplane, that
aeronautical progress is paced by an engine’s “pounds per horsepower,”
and that the air-cooled engine, as yet quite undeveloped,
offered the greatest promise of usefulness to the Navy. Meanwhile,
with the Engine Section as the focus of that development, no dull
moments loomed on the horizon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_THREE">CHAPTER THREE<br>
Its Vital Spark</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Next morning we resumed my indoctrination, as we did on subsequent
mornings. Leighton began by expounding the advantages
of air-cooled over liquid-cooled engines, especially from the viewpoint
of naval aviation. The Army could, of course, spread out all
over the prairies, but the Navy must ride on the “backs of the fleet.”</p>

<p>“If,” I interposed, “it is as clear-cut as that, what has been retarding
the development?” Leighton heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>“Inertia and politics,” he replied. “If you have gained an impression
that engine development is all engineering, you are in for a
shock. All the engineers in the industry insist that, theoretically, it
is impossible to build an air-cooled engine to compete with liquid-cooled,
and their politicians keep busy making the prediction come
true.”</p>

<p>“Politicians?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Some of them,” Leighton replied, “are right here in the Bureau,
but they are influenced by the liquid-cooled engine builders, and it
is easy to understand the position of these fellows. They’ve already
got a big stake in liquid-cooling: production facilities, engineering,
and know-how—especially know-how. Naturally they aren’t
scrambling to obsolete their own designs.” Leighton paused.</p>

<p>“Before you finish your shore cruise,” he added, “you’ll get a
bellyful of engineering politics.”</p>

<p>It developed that when Admiral Moffett had first created the
Bureau, he expected to bring under his wing all aviation functions
such as personnel, matériel, and operations, but vested interests had
thwarted him. The Bureau of Navigation (“BUNAV,” it was
called) charged with responsibility for personnel had hung on for
grim death to its prerogatives with respect to naval aviators. While
conceding to BUAERO the privilege of recommending assignments,
it reserved to itself the authority to turn BUAERO down whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Admiral Moffett seemed to be getting a little too big for his britches.
Again, Naval Operations (OPNAV) had held strict control of all
aviation operations. As a concession, they had detailed naval aviators
to liaison jobs in BUNAV, OPNAV, and on flag duty in the fleet—where
they had carefully preserved the functions of these young
specialists in the formaldehyde of an “advisory” capacity.</p>

<p>But Admiral Moffett had proved a match for most of them. The
only high-ranking officer in the Navy Department with a flair for
public relations, and the one man trained from boyhood in a school
of practical politics, Admiral Moffett had shown a knack for getting
aviation appropriations from Congress. Not too long on logic, the
admiral had demonstrated a native intelligence and a knack with
phrases that had netted him dividends. “Of course the country needs
an air force,” he had said before a naval affairs committee, “but let’s
make it a naval air force, one that isn’t anchored to a land base but can
go to sea—on the backs of the fleet.” And that expression “on the
backs of the fleet” had become a byword in BUAERO.</p>

<p>From Leighton’s thumbnail sketch of BUAERO I noted that there
was little system or organization to it. Leighton conceded as much.</p>

<p>“We have no organization chart, let alone a bureau manual. Somebody
is supposed to be working on one but somehow it never gets
beyond the admiral’s desk. His organization is personal rather than
functional—based on loyalties. Every man or woman in this Bureau,”
he asserted with emphasis, “would go to hell and back for good
old Billy Moffett. And loyalty works both ways; the admiral’s most
striking quality is his loyalty to his subordinates. Sometimes I’m not
so sure about it to his seniors; he loves to needle the old whales on
topside.” Leighton smiled as if in recollection of specific instances.</p>

<p>“No,” he went on, “there is never a dull moment in BUAERO. It
reminds me of that old adage handed down from the days of iron
men and wooden ships, ‘When in trouble or in doubt, run in circles,
yell, and shout.’ And that, my dear successor,” he concluded, “is
BUAERO in a nutshell—or should I say bombshell?”</p>

<p>The Bureau had set up as its number-one project, the job of “selling
aviation to the fleet,” and a fleet full of sales resistance at that. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Bureau had designed catapults—big compressed-air guns, for launching
airplanes from the decks of battle wagons at sea. It had designed
or procured new seaplanes to be launched by these catapults. It had
trained aviators to man these planes, and incidentally, to try to sell
them to the ships.</p>

<p>In this they had met hard sledding because those unwieldy catapults
had cluttered up the decks, destroyed the symmetry of the
ships’ silhouettes, and shed grease all over the precious teak decks.
However, the aviators had penetrated the cold front by learning how
to spot the fall of shot in long-range battle practice, and how to
signal the ship the correction that would put a salvo on a target.
Ships with planes had thus gained an advantage in the gunnery competition
over those that had none, and besides, their pilots had been
trained for deck duty and could share watches at sea or in port.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BUAERO had pushed on with its plans to match the
British in carrier aircraft. Under the leadership of Kenneth Whiting,
who as Commander of the Northern Bombing Group at Killingholm,
Scotland, during the war had sent Godfrey de Chevalier down to
the Grand Fleet to observe carrier operations, the old electric-drive
collier <em>Jupiter</em> had been converted to the experimental carrier <em>Langley</em>,
and pilots had been trained in deck landings, to gain experience
from which to design new carrier aircraft. Here, too, the air-cooled
engine offered important advantages, provided it could be made dependable.
That job was to become the first order of business for the
new chief of the Engine Section.</p>

<p>As a further extension of this carrier development, Admiral Moffett
had put over a master stroke at the Washington Limitation of
Arms Conference. At a time when the United States was making
the fatal gesture of scrapping all its latest vessels, to bring “peace
through disarmament,” the admiral had salvaged from the scrap heap
the giant battle cruisers <em>Saratoga</em> and <em>Lexington</em>, and was now supervising
their conversion into the largest aircraft carriers in the world.
In this he had been greatly aided by Capt. Henry C. Mustin, who had
since died. Mustin, a wise man with a clear understanding of the principles
of war as they might be affected by aviation, had drawn up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
a complete plan for the complements of the carriers. They would
have single-seat fighters to gain command of the air, long-range
scouts to obtain information of the enemy, torpedo bombers for attacking
enemy vessels, and rescue craft for recovering pilots that
might be forced down at sea. The larger craft would demand high-powered
engines and since, as yet, we had no air-cooled engines
above 200 horsepower, we must needs speed our high-powered
liquid-cooled development to the limit.</p>

<p>Leighton gave me his own quick estimate of the personalities in
the Bureau other than the admiral. The Assistant Chief was Capt.
Alfred W. Johnson, an old Queenstown destroyer skipper. Brought
up in the old school, he had been my skipper on the notorious Caribbean
cruise of the seaplane tender and kite-balloon ship <em>Wright</em>, and
I loved and admired him. We had both fought a losing battle against
aviation extravagance. The skipper, hoping to cut down useless paper
work by refusing to have a yeoman, had answered all his own correspondence
in longhand, expecting thus to shame his correspondents
into doing likewise, but only he had been shamed.</p>

<p>The Chief of the Matériel Division was Capt. Emory S. Land, of
the Corps of Constructors. Unlike so many constructors, Jerry was
no theorist but a thoroughly practical and competent leader. He had
played football at the Academy and still refereed college games. Able
to see both sides of an argument, forthright, and honest, he was an
ideal head for a division like Matériel that contained both naval
constructors and line officers. The old line-staff controversy was
likely to burst out at any moment, and it took a sense of humor to
break it up.</p>

<p>The Design Section of the Matériel Division, under which the
Engine Section was set up, was headed by a grand old man of aviation,
Capt. H. C. Richardson. “Captain Dick,” one of the early
pilots, a member of the crew of one of the NC boats of 1919 transatlantic
fame, and a skilled engineer, had inherited Design from
“Jerry” Hunsaker, a classmate of mine, when Jerry resigned from the
Construction Corps to go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology
as a professor. Jerry had founded the Design Group, and had built up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
a large drafting room and staff with which to carry on naval aviation
design. His designs were to be built experimentally at the Naval
Aircraft Factory at Philadelphia and then farmed out to the factory,
or perhaps to some willing private manufacturer.</p>

<p>It was right at this point that Leighton stressed a difference between
the Engine Section and the Design Section. There were but a handful
of people all told in the Engine Section: Leighton himself; his
assistant, Lt. Frank Maile, who had once served with me on the <em>Old
Ark</em>; Lt. Ricco Botta, a former Reserve officer and a skilled engineer;
Lt. (jg) Ralph M. Parsons, a former student under Dr. Lucke and my
assistant at the Aviation Mechanics Schools at Great Lakes; and two
secretaries. The senior secretary was Miss Alma Quisenberry, a
quiet, soft-spoken young woman from Nashville, Tennessee. And
this handful of people not only had no desire to design or build its
own engines but had a clear conviction that the hope for the future
lay in the Bureau’s placing its dependence for design, development,
and production entirely upon private industry.</p>

<p>In this respect, the Engine Section now stood quite alone. After
the Armistice, the Army Air Service had devised a plan for setting
up a great government production center at McCook Field, near
Dayton, Ohio. Army aircraft were to be designed by brain trusters
in government employ. The institution would be surrounded by
a complex of interested private manufacturers who would produce
aircraft to Army design and specification. The plan had fallen
through, largely because ambitious young men had preferred to
risk their futures in chancey private industry rather than rest secure
in the dead end of a government establishment. But the idea still persisted,
and many in both Army and Navy were still sold on nationalization
for the aircraft industry.</p>

<p>I could tell from Leighton’s development of this knotty problem
that he was still uncertain as to where I stood. Conceivably I might
be one who would want to build up a great engine-design group in
BUAERO and another big production group at the Philadelphia
Aircraft Factory and thus establish for myself quite a respectable
empire. However, I had developed a few positive ideas of my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
on the subject, and, curiously enough they had come out of the
old rifle shooting competitions. I now relieved Leighton on this subject,
obviously so close to his heart.</p>

<p>Under the rules for the national rifle matches, it was mandatory
for military competitors to use government-issue cartridges, which,
at the time, were produced solely by the government at Frankfort
Arsenal. In quality this ammunition was reminiscent of Chinese
firecrackers—many were complete duds, and of those that finally
went off, many more were just “fizzlers.” As to accuracy, there were
so many “droppers” in each bandoleer that the element of skill was
largely neutralized by the element of chance, thus undermining the
foundation of competition. And worse still, there seemed to be
nothing we could do about it. Army Ordnance, entrenched in its
monopoly, turned a deaf ear to all complaints.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the quality of the ammunition provided by competing
commercial companies for civilian matches had improved to the
point where Frankfort Arsenal had become a public scandal among
the shooting fraternity. At this point the National Rifle Association
had raised such a furor that the Ordnance Department was forced
down off its lofty perch and obliged to bring Frankfort into direct
competition with the private trade. Improvement at Frankfort was
immediate, but more important still, seeds were planted for a new
government-industry cooperation in ordnance that has since paid
off in two wars.</p>

<p>And so, having acquired my convictions at an early age and out
of the hard school of experience, I now set Leighton right on my
position as to the place of government in production. His relief was
immediate, though he felt that the situation in aviation was less
critical.</p>

<p>“We have the saving grace,” he said, “of having strong competition
within the government. As long as the rivalry between
BUAERO and the Army Air Service continues keen, both of us
will keep on our toes to press development.”</p>

<p>My thoughts drifted back to the interview with Admiral Moffett
earlier in the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“But,” I countered, “suppose your friend Billy Mitchell should
sell his independent-air-force idea to the Congress and take over the
whole shebang, then what would become of your interservice rivalry?”</p>

<p>Leighton tossed both hands in the air in a gesture of helplessness.
“Do you know the gentleman?” he asked.</p>

<p>I had met the general at Great Lakes back in 1920 when he had
come up on a flying tour of inspection of the Aviation Mechanics’
Schools. He arrived at the wheel of a roaring Stutz Bearcat touring
car, with the top down, the cutouts open, and a white-faced sergeant
hanging onto the seat beside him. He’d broken all records on the
run up from Chicago. Later the sergeant informed one of our CPOs
that he had long ago exceeded his life expectancy and was now on
borrowed time.</p>

<p>At that time, our schools, organized as they had been by Dr. Lucke,
were going like a house afire, while the nearby Army schools, at
Rantoul, Illinois, were dragging bottom. At the close of the inspection,
the general had remarked, without the quiver of an eyelid,
“Keep working, Commander, and some day you may catch up with
the Army.”</p>

<p>As I opened my mouth to retort, he blimped the throttle and
jammed the words down my throat, with the roar of his exhaust.
The last I saw of him was a cloud of dust as he whirled away in the
direction of the main gate, his sergeant hanging on with both hands.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Mitchell had kept up a running fire against the
Navy until he finally badgered the Department into anchoring some
obsolete vessels in Chesapeake Bay, close to the Army air base at
Langley Field, Virginia. In a masterly display of showmanship for
the benefit of the newsmen, Mitchell had delivered a mast-high attack
on the undefended targets at short range. One phosphorous
bomb dropped on the fighting top of the old <em>Alabama</em>, where an
alert photographer snapped a dramatic picture of pyrotechnics that
made the front page with a convincing smash.</p>

<p>All this had come along with the drive for reduction in armaments
that had already set the Navy back on its haunches. Navy top brass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
fighting hard for survival, had recognized in Billy Mitchell another
Brutus, and some had even suspected Billy Moffett of a lean and
hungry look. An old walrus over in Naval Operations had been
heard to remark that Moffett was probably jealous of Mitchell for
having first thought of the separate air force. In any event, the Old
Navy had come to hate its own aviation almost as much at it hated
Mitchell and the Army.</p>

<p>“Mitchell,” I remarked, “is able, impetuous, and dynamic. He
has an attractive personality and is long on the qualities that keep
men willing to ride with him, hell for leather.”</p>

<p>Leighton shook his head. “He takes a lot for granted. The time may
come when airplanes will do the things he foresees, but first some
of us slaves will have to solve a lot of the impossible technical problems
that he now brushes off as unimportant. And one thing is
sure,” he added, “under the sort of department Mitchell advocates,
they just won’t get solved. Give him his autocratic control, and
he’ll set up an airtight government monopoly of research, development,
and production that will lay the dead hand of bureaucracy on
our new art and paralyze its glowing young spirit.” All the smile
had gone out of Leighton’s voice and deadly earnestness replaced
the half-banter with which he had discussed his job.</p>

<p>“Well,” he sighed, “there’s just one man standing between Mitchell
and the attainment of his personal ambition for power.” He paused.
“And that man,” he concluded, “is William Adger Moffett.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s got what it takes?” I asked. Leighton nodded.
“He’s got a mind like a steel trap. And believe me, he’s no counter-puncher—he
bores in like Old Battling Burroughs, the fleet
champion, and keeps leading all the time, though never with his
chin...”</p>

<p>“He’s our catalyst,” Leighton continued, “the mysterious reagent
that keeps all our atoms and molecules in a state of constant, frenzied
excitement. He’s the ignition system of BUAERO. We chiefs of
section are the explosive mixtures and when the admiral sparks us,
we give the pistons a wallop and they start the connecting rods oscillating.
That rotates the cranks, of which I am one,” he added with
a grin, “and the whole thing turns over like an aircraft engine—high-strung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
parts whipping back and forth, between clearances the
width of a gnat’s eyebrow. And, to complete our power-plant picture,”
he concluded, “the whole thing would burn out except for
the admiral’s other function; he’s the lubricant, a high-grade product
of some refinery that created him and then threw away the formula.
It all looks a bit hectic and confused but, amazingly enough, it produces
results.”</p>

<p>“But,” I asked, “what if the Congress is more impressed by the
dynamic leader with all the right answers?”</p>

<p>“Then,” Leighton replied with finality, “the country will be lost.
Lost,” he repeated, quoting the punch line of an old Navy yarn
about the sailor man weaving his way back to the boat landing
through a line of telephone poles, “lost in an impenetrable forest.”</p>

<p>After returning to our hotel that evening, I reviewed the day’s
disclosures with my wife. We had both found that this was beneficial,
on general principles, and besides, since a Navy wife is nearly as
much subject to Navy Regulations as her husband, it seemed no
more than fair.</p>

<p>Apparently this Army-Navy dogfight absorbed every waking
hour of the combatants. Since the power plant is clearly the heart of
the airplane, then it followed that the Engine Section was a decisive
front in a major campaign. The technical issue of air-cooled versus
liquid-cooled involved the ancient conflict of government monopoly
versus private industry. And there was no question where Admiral
Moffett might stand on that. Though armed with authority, he
showed the wisdom to use it sparingly. With faith in the processes
of nature, he had the guts to let nature take her course. In this
respect he was the direct opposite of General Mitchell. Their conflict
went right down to bedrock.</p>

<p>As my job in the struggle, the admiral had assigned me the task
of creating a new line of engines. This I would do through fair competition
and in private industry. The problem was tough because
the industry was flat on its back. On the other hand, it was exciting
because the admiral’s convictions were my convictions, and well
worth fighting for. Maybe that was the reason he had reached down
into the Caribbean for me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_FOUR">CHAPTER FOUR<br>
A Backward Art</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">By the time the Japanese cherry blossoms had come and gone
around the Tidal Basin, my wife and I had settled in our apartment
at 2301 Connecticut Avenue, and joined the social whirl—cocktail
parties on bathtub gin, formal dinners at home or abroad, evenings
of bridge, or just plain conversation. And wherever friends gathered,
their one and only topic of conversation was “shop.” While
this was true of all Navy parties, it was especially so in aviation
circles. The burning zeal these young pilots displayed for their
profession was a constant source of wonderment to us. In what
they affectionately characterized as their “old crates”—a description
often all too accurate—they found the beginning and end of
everything. And if the airplane itself was the object of their veneration,
the “Aviation Game,” as they fondly called it, was their religion.
This seemed the more remarkable, for the airplane was ever
a jealous mistress, one that brooked no liberties, a fact well known
to the aviators who had solemnly escorted all too many friends off
to their last resting place, across the river in Arlington.</p>

<p>Take young Hersey Conant, for one example out of many.
Hersey, a delightfully gay young bachelor, had gained the distinction
of coining a popular phrase, so to speak. At an afternoon cocktail
party, where the gin had just been lifted almost steaming off
the kitchen stove, Hersey had mixed it solemnly with orange juice
and ice and then held his glass aloft for a toast. Pausing before tossing
it off, he had said quite simply, “Let it age a second!” Here, it seemed,
was a suggestion the whole Aviation Game might take to heart;
but it didn’t.</p>

<p>For the very next day, Hersey had blithely taken off in one of the
fast Schneider-Cup seaplane racers for a short practice spin, and
had hedgehopped his way toward Norfolk, flying right down on
the water. Somewhere along the way, he stubbed his toe on one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the many fish traps and pitched headlong into shallow water. When
a crane salvaged the wreck it was all wrapped up in a ball.</p>

<p>Old Navy families looked with jaundiced eyes upon the heedless
carryings on of the aviators. At a dinner party one night my wife
sat next to Capt. Claude C. Bloch, then Chief of the Bureau of
Ordnance, and one of the most promising of the younger captains.
The day would come when, as Commandant of the Naval District
at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he would receive a visit from
the little yellow men, but back there in the middle ’twenties, his
promising career still lay before him. Then, addressing my wife
earnestly, he gave her the benefit of his advice.</p>

<p>“Tell that husband of yours,” he said, “to keep out of the side
shows and get back under the main tent.” Well, I’d tried to become
a gunnery officer but fate had made a Kiwi of me.</p>

<p>And down in BUAERO, Leighton continued day by day to
unfold to me the fantastic story of naval aviation.</p>

<p>“Now that you are well fouled up in the slipstream of BUAERO,”
he remarked one June morning, “it is about time you looked over
the trade. If,” he went on, “you are going to risk your future on
the creative capacity of competition, then you ought to look over
your new tools. Frankly,” he added, “they aren’t too hot.” So
Leighton asked Captain Johnson, Assistant Chief, for permission to
make the trip in a cross-country DH, but the captain turned him
down. Later on he advised me in confidence that engineers were too
scarce to be risked unnecessarily in those flying coffins. And so we
took off by train.</p>

<p>At Paterson, New Jersey, we sought out the multistoried loft
building that housed Wright Aeronautical Corporation. President
Frederick B. Rentschler received us in his office, sitting solemnly
behind his desk. He looked to be a cool customer, a man of great
singleness of purpose. Facing him across the table, Bruce Leighton
exuded buoyant enthusiasm against a background of equal determination.
Not having previously learned from Leighton the
sharp differences in opinion between these two, I was unprepared
for the sparring match that followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Leighton led off with an inquiry as to progress with the new
J-3 model of the Lawrance air-cooled radial, which Rentschler
fended off with a report on the splendid dependability shown by
the liquid-cooled Hispano E-4 in its endurance tests. He had in
mind that if Leighton would recommend another production order
of Hispanos, Wright could use the time to get the Lawrance ready
for the next production order. A flush spread up around Leighton’s
ears as he rather testily replied that the Bureau was already definitely
committed to air-cooled engines in the 200-horsepower size, and that
it was Wright’s job to speed developments to meet Bureau requirements.
Rentschler seemed to have a quiet knack of automatically tuning
out any wave length he did not care to listen in on. Now he passed
up the Hispano-Lawrance issue momentarily to develop the basic difference
of opinion. He clearly felt that with all Wright’s accumulated
experience in liquid-cooled, they could expect to make more rapid
progress with them than with Lawrance air-cooled.</p>

<p>Leighton let a smile flicker across his lips and redirected the discussion
toward air-cooling. On the way up to Paterson, he had told
me about a contract Wright had with the Navy for the development
of a new 400-hp air-cooled radial called “P-1.” Intended as an
out and out replacement for the Liberty, the engine promised to
save a lot of weight although it was just an overgrown Lawrance as
to design. Now he asked Rentschler for a report on its progress.</p>

<p>Rentschler shrugged his shoulders in a gesture of hopelessness
and reported that George Mead and Andy Willgoos, the Wright
engineers, had encountered serious difficulties with piston scuffing.
They were struggling with the usual cut-and-try “fixes” but so
far with little positive success. Leighton thought that under the
criticism of the liquid-cooled partisans he might have specified too
small a diameter for the engine and suggested that if I agreed I
might modify the requirements if absolutely necessary. Meanwhile,
however, he was determined to push the new engine to the limit.</p>

<p>Rentschler shook his head in disagreement. He thought the problem
went deeper than Leighton had indicated. He had a tendency
to probe for fundamentals and it was his considered opinion that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
for Wright at least, liquid-cooling offered the better course of engine
development. Air-cooling, even though it might have inherent
advantages in weight saving, suffered a handicap from the point of
view of timing, and he doubted if these could be overcome. He
preferred undertaking a completely new design by Wright to trying
to get the bugs out of the Lawrance.</p>

<p>Leighton twisted in his chair as the flush spread up his neck and
flooded through the gray at his temples. He had detected a note of
arrogance in Rentschler’s suave statement—an inference of sure
judgment on the part of the civilian as opposed to the immaturity of
the naval officer. I made a note of this fundamental conflict as
Leighton set his jaw.</p>

<p>The Navy didn’t propose to let anything stand in its way in
realizing on the inherent superiority of air-cooling. Aside from the
potential weight saving there was the vital factor of dependability.
One-third of all Navy power-plant failures could be charged to
liquid-cooled plumbing—leaky water jackets, leaky hose connections,
and what have you.</p>

<p>“In other words,” he summed up, “in addition to saving the
weight of the plumbing we can eliminate the majority of engine
failures by going to air-cooled engines. We’re your customers,” he
added, “and that’s our position.”</p>

<p>Rentschler’s face was a mask. The muscles of his jaw flexed as
he faced Leighton. The latter broke the tension.</p>

<p>“What do you say,” he queried, “to our taking a look at the new
air-cooled engines?”</p>

<p>We took a slow-running freight elevator that dropped us to
the basement, where George Mead waited for us in the experimental
department. A solidly built fellow in his early thirties, with dark
bushy eyebrows, George had the serious mein of the well-trained
engineer but he combined this with unusual force and driving power.
No one in the aircraft industry could drive a project to completion
with such remorseless energy. Now he pointed to a large radial
engine mounted on a teardown stand with its ignition wiring partly
stripped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“There she is,” he remarked. The big engine was being torn down
after a full-throttle run. She was up to rated horsepower but still
scuffed her pistons. They were trying one more “fix” and if this
one worked, they intended to go back on an endurance run. No suggestion
of doubt entered Mead’s cheerful voice.</p>

<p>Rentschler stood noncommittal. An engineer must needs be an
optimist; his job is a creative one. Day after day he has to bow his
head against an avalanche of grief, from failures either in his own
shop or the field, yet still press on to correct the faults. There were
no margins for error in this aircraft-engine business; the machinery
was stressed right up to the limit. The trick was to keep it from
going beyond, and the penalty for failure might be somebody’s life.
Management had plenty of worries, too; Rentschler, there, must
wangle the financial problems and try to reconcile the conflicting
interests of the several departments of a complex organization.</p>

<p>Now while Leighton and Mead discussed the teething troubles of
their new baby with all the intense interest of a couple of young
mothers, I tried to pick out the fundamental factors of the situation
at Wright Aeronautical. BUAERO had taken the decision to
stake its future on the trade. Wright Aero was our best bet. We
were committed to air-cooled radials and the management of Wright
was still committed, subconsciously at least, to liquid-cooled in-line.
It wasn’t a matter of sentiment with them; they had a big investment
in their prior art. The big job from the point of view of the
Engine Section was to instill some of our own enthusiasm into
Wright Aero, and this would take some doing. As we left the factory
to go to a hotel for lunch, I realized I had my job cut out for me.</p>

<p>Next day we ran down to Keyport, New Jersey, for a look at
the Aeromarine Airplane and Motor Corporation plant. It was a
discouraging picture, acres of idle machine shops and a powerhouse
smokestack that gave out no smoke. The one bright spot there
proved to be Roland Chilton, the chief engineer, a keen Englishman
whom I mentally clothed in a costume for the <em>Midsummer Night’s
Dream</em>. He had the inventor’s talent for innovation, with the engineer’s
knack for making ingenious mechanical contrivances work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
and he had created for Leighton the new Aeromarine Inertia Starter.
This device, which utilized energy stored in a fast-running flywheel
to crank over obstinate engines, had proved an outstanding success in
the limited quantities Leighton had bought. Leighton had tried to
keep Aeromarine alive in the hope that times might change for the
better, but the air-cooled radials would obsolete the Aeromarine
liquid-cooled in-line engines, just as they had set aside the Wright
Hispano E-4.</p>

<p>A train ride to Boston took us to the plant of the Kinney Manufacturing
Company. Their main product was heavy-duty pumps,
a far cry from aircraft engines, but the management had shown a
willingness to gamble on the remarkable ingenuity of its aircraft
engineer, Warren Noble. His forte, like Chilton’s, was a unique
capacity for accomplishing the impossible through little-used mechanical
devices and principles. If anything, he was even more ingenious
than Chilton, but by the same token a little less productive;
once he had made some contraption work, experimentally, he lost
interest in it. Production for profit seemed to bore him. But at
Leighton’s request, he had undertaken to build a tiny, five-cylinder,
air-cooled radial engine for a miniature airplane—one intended to
be folded up and parked in a steel cylinder mounted on the deck of
a submarine. The job, which imposed every known restriction on
the already complicated airplane-design problem, intrigued Noble
no end. His engine, with its oil-operated valve gear, incorporated
every other unconventional device Noble’s fertile brain could conceive,
and it ran. Beyond that point, Noble’s interest faded.</p>

<p>We left Boston stimulated by talking far into the night with Noble,
exploring the realms of engineering fancy, but down in our hearts
we knew the little engine would never get anywhere. After all the
airplane itself was highly experimental and might never fly; the
outlook for quantity production of air scouts for submarines was
not encouraging. But it was worth the trip just to listen to the conversation
of one of the most facile engineering minds in the business.</p>

<p>From Boston we moved out to the Army Engineering Division,
then at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, one of those government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
arsenal-type establishments and about as far apart from Warren
Noble as it was possible to get while still remaining on the same
planet. The chief of the Engine Branch out there was Ed Jones, a
former Air Service major, now in civilian clothes, and a good solid
citizen. He displayed none of the usual Air Service antagonism to
naval aviation, and received us warmly.</p>

<p>His assistant, Sam Herron, was, like Chilton, a clever Englishman,
one who had done highly useful research in air-cooled cylinders
under Professor Gibson, in England, then the outstanding man in
his field. Sam Herron was probably better informed on this important
subject than anyone in this country and had done some
good work even under the handicaps of a government establishment
like McCook Field. Among other things “The Field,” as it was called
by the Air Service, had designed a 300-hp air-cooled radial engine
which it had turned over to the Curtiss Airplane and Motor Company,
of Buffalo, after competitive bidding, for construction of
the first experimental model.</p>

<p>Leighton expressed lack of confidence in this procedure, which
had carried over from the war. When disorderly reconversion had
forced the automotive people out of aircraft production, “The Field”
had determined to establish a great engineering division at Dayton,
and to undertake its own design. After the government wizards had
dreamed up their pet projects, a manufacturer would do the rest.
Leighton argued that this procedure just divided the responsibility
for a development between the government and the industry.</p>

<p>“The government,” he remarked, “will claim all the credit for
everything that turns out well, and will hang the contractor for all
mistakes, especially its own.” That, he insisted, was not the road
to success.</p>

<p>“The only way to get progress,” he added, “is to put a good engineer
in a tight place where he will have to fight to survive. When
it’s ‘root, hog, or die,’” he concluded, “they always do the impossible.”</p>

<p>A run over to Detroit brought us to the Packard Motor Car Company,
and another kind of setup. Here was one of the few remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
automotive companies with a continuing interest in aviation. This
had probably resulted from the fact that Col. Jesse G. Vincent, a
Packard vice-president, had been one of the designers of the original
Liberty, and Capt. Lionel Woolson, Packard experimental engineer,
still retained his interest in aircraft. The company felt that much of
the aviation experimental work could be used in the automotive
engines and was willing to continue to participate as a public service.
In another emergency, in which the automotive industry must
again convert to aircraft production, they could do a better job at
it, against a background of continuing experience with aviation.
The one drawback to this picture was the air-cooled engine; Packard
could hardly be expected to show much enthusiasm for this.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was another consideration involved in continuing
the automotive industry on a stand-by basis with respect
to aircraft.</p>

<p>“Automobile prices,” Leighton explained, “demand low-cost
volume production, a requirement that is just incompatible with the
high-quality, high-precision production required in aircraft. When
your automobile breaks down,” he added, quoting the old darky
of the ancient wheeze, “why there yo’ is. But when yo’ airplane
engine quits, where is yo’?”</p>

<p>And now as we moved on to Buffalo, Leighton gave me a quick
preview of the Curtiss Airplane and Motor Company. Here was
one of the “old-line” aircraft organizations. Though it had bid in
the Army air-cooled radial project, now called the “Curtiss Radial
1454,” its heart lay in the liquid-cooled development. The Curtiss
D-12 was now one of the best in the world; both the Army and the
Navy were using it in fair quantities. Curtiss, he thought, was one of
the smartest engine builders in the country—sometimes he had
wondered if they weren’t a little too smart for their own good.</p>

<p>When we saw the R-1454, we were impressed. Herron’s cylinder
was an advance over anything we had seen at Wright. The valve-gear
rocker boxes enclosed the valves and provided forced lubrication
for them in place of the old Alemite fittings of our P-1. And the
Curtiss had a single carburetor in place of the triple type on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Wright, an improvement made possible partly by the use of a
gear-driven blower that sucked the mixture from the carburetor
and pushed it up to the cylinders. This was geared low for rotary
induction, and gave fine distribution; someday it could be geared
high for supercharging.</p>

<p>That evening we were dinner guests of the company at a hotel
overlooking Niagara Falls. Afterward, Arthur Nutt, chief engineer,
gave us a sales talk on the D-12. Roy Keyes, president of the company,
expressed no fear of competition from the air-cooled radials.
Curtiss, he confided in us, had bid in the Army 1454 just to keep
it under their control. He considered it unlikely that any radial rock
crusher could replace the D-12; in fact, he had no intention of letting
it.</p>

<p>That night, Leighton and I sat on the edges of our twin beds in
the hotel room and, smoking a last cigarette together, sized up the
situation. Curtiss, a good manufacturer, had a fine engine but was
keeping it under wraps. Wright, also a competent producer, had an
inferior engine and no enthusiasm for air-cooling as such. The problem
was to get the best features of the Herron-designed 1454 into
the second engine of our P-series at Wright. If we could sell them
on that and build up their enthusiasm, we might put a new set of
valves in the heart of the airplane and even build up its muscles. That
called for another visit to Paterson.</p>

<p>But when we returned to Wright Aero we found that a change
had taken place. Fred Rentschler had resigned from the presidency,
leaving Charles Lanier Lawrance, the daddy of the American air-cooled
radial, in his place. There was nothing left to worry about on
the score of air-cooled enthusiasm, though the company had lost
an able executive. Guy Vaughan, a dynamic and personable fellow,
had moved up from quality manager to factory manager. A former
automobile racing driver, Guy had plenty of zing. With George
Mead to do a finished engineering job, we could release the P-2 engine
with all the latest wrinkles in it.</p>

<p>Back at BUAERO, Bruce Leighton wound up his affairs in the
Engine Section. For three and a half years he had fought and bled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
there, stacking up brief moments of triumph against hours of grief.
As a matter of fact, aircraft engines were one big pain in the neck.
Reports of poor performance in service streamed in under the heading
“Trouble Report.” If by some chance they performed well, that
was only as it should be and certainly not a subject for comment.
The art was still young, and even the best equipment could hardly
be classified as safe to fly. In the face of disheartening problems, Bruce
Leighton had never let his enthusiasm slacken; his heart and soul
were all wrapped up in what he himself characterized as “these funny
damned airplanes.” He had pioneered air-cooled engines in the
face of universal resistance; he had stood by private industry when
everyone else had plumped for government ownership. Now he
was “off to sea.”</p>

Toil and Trouble</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The summer of 1925, like most summers in the nation’s capital,
was almost unbearably hot and sultry. Even after one of those violent
electrical storms had whirled up the Potomac and deluged the blistered
asphalt with a tropical downpour, its passing left the whole
town sweltering in a steaming heat, even more prostrating than
before the storm. It was sticky enough in the permanent buildings,
but in our temporary shack on Constitution Avenue, work became
quite impossible, and we often sent the Bureau staff home in the
early afternoons. And before that fateful summer could pass, lightning
struck twice in the same place—BUAERO.</p>

<p>When Bruce Leighton had passed out to sea, most of his small staff
went with him, having already overstayed their allotted period of
duty on shore. Luckily, Ricco Botta, a lieutenant who had come in
by way of the Naval Reserve, held over with me. A pilot, an engineer,
and a skilled mechanic he had now become the practical
wheelhorse of the Engine Section. Later on, Henry Mullinix joined
up, bringing just the right qualities to balance out our little organization.
Henry had been honor man in his class at Annapolis, had later
led his flight class at Pensacola, and had finally completed the aviation
postgraduate course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
with top honors. And along with his intellect, Henry had a fine
personality and an admirable character. Our organization was
rounded out by young Lt. (jg) Ralph Parsons, who now handled the
highly technical liaison with the Aero Engine Laboratory at the
Naval Aircraft Factory, Philadelphia, while Henry, Ricco, and I
concentrated on the task of cleaning up the bugs in the engines and
accessories under our cognizance.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Lawrance J-1 air-cooled radial engine,
that coffee grinder on which all our hopes were based. It was so
rickety that Lt. C. C. Champion, a rising young West Coast pilot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
formally reported to BUAERO that, when embarking on a fifteen-mile
cross-country flight from the Naval Air Station at North
Island, near San Diego, to an emergency airport at Ream Field, down
near the Mexican border, his squadron always carried a whole
“quiverful” of spare push rods to replace those sure to be sprayed
along the beach of the Coronado Silver Strand. Our treatment for
this sort of trouble was to call in Charlie Lawrance or Guy Vaughan
of Wright Aero and give them a session of plain and fancy kidding,
with just the right amount of sting in it.</p>

<p>The magnetos for our air-cooled engines were something to write
home about. Here was the instrument that provided the vital spark
so essential to keep the engine ticking over, yet it had proved the
least dependable of the parts of the high-strung mechanism behind
which pilots risked their lives. And when we looked around for
more promising sources of supply, none was to be found. The
Delco Company, producers of the wartime Liberty battery-generator
ignition systems, could not be interested in a new development;
the volume to be expected was too small. The manufacturer of cheap
truck magnetos, to whom we now looked, was willing to brighten
up the outside finish but was unwilling to go further for the same
reason—no volume. The board of directors of the great General
Electric Company had, we were advised, studied the problem with
ponderous care and finally concluded there was more money in
electric light bulbs. A small privately owned company was willing
to help, but lacked know-how. It looked like a stalemate until
the Army Engineering Division at McCook Field discovered Scintilla.</p>

<p>Scintilla magnetos proved to be the answer to a maiden’s prayer.
Made in Soleure, Switzerland, they could be bought through Tom
Fagan, of New York, and at a reasonable price. However, since we
could not place full dependence on a foreign source that might be
cut off in time of war, we investigated the possibility of creating an
American source. The Swiss company had an excess of machinery
and personnel and was willing to export them, but the red tape surrounding
such a transaction, even back there in the days when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
United States government had faith in private enterprise, tied us
hand and foot. To cut through the tangle involved so many risks
that we should have been completely discouraged save that the
other alternative was to accept responsibility for the deaths of youngsters
who daily risked their lives in the air.</p>

<p>In dilemmas of this kind, resort might be had to what was politely
called “memoranda for file” but known privately as “the cover-up.”
A letter was prepared for the file covering the details of the proposed
transaction and carried through the whole system to be finally
approved by the Secretary of the Navy himself. Then, after the
Great Seal of the Navy Department had been attached, and the author
had privately retained a copy for his own use, the document was
carefully filed away against the day when some Congressional investigation
might be looking for a noteworthy scalp. When the
spirit of cover-up gets into a business organization, the evil finally
shows up in the financial results; in government it is just absorbed
by the taxpayer.</p>

<p>It was through such a time-consuming process that we finally
succeeded in transporting a part of the Swiss company bodily to
the town of Sidney, New York, where it continued to be this
country’s source of dependable magnetos. And the time even came
when I had to flash the Great Seal of the Navy Department to keep
from being crucified for bringing it here. Later, when Charles A.
Lindbergh arrived in London, after having flown the Atlantic behind
a Scintilla magneto, it turned out that the General Electric Company
had all along had the license to manufacture the British Thompson
Houston Company’s magneto, but no one in Schenectady had recalled
the fact.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in addition to concentrating on the job of keeping
engines running, we had not neglected the other task of getting
them started. The Aeromarine Inertia Starter, created by Chilton
under Leighton’s initiative, though employing a quite novel principle—the
utilization of energy stored in a flywheel—had developed
into the most dependable and efficient device in our gear locker.
When, therefore, Messrs. Charles Marcus and Raymond P. Lansing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of the Eclipse Machine Company called on us with a view to interesting
us in a line of electric starters they had developed for the
Army, we presented them with an affable but none the less impenetrable
front. Things electric not only involved heavy lead
storage batteries, heavy copper motors, and everything else designed
around “base metals,” but they always proved undependable and
difficult to maintain. My years as engineer officer on a man-of-war
had generated in me a sales resistance of many ohms.</p>

<p>On the day when we were honored with the visit from Charles
Marcus and Ray Lansing, I bolstered my disinterest with a glowing
and somewhat detailed account of the virtues of the Chilton starter
and was somewhat taken aback by Charles Marcus’s suave remark
that Aeromarine had infringed an Eclipse patent involving the
fundamentals of the Bendix drive. Marcus doubted that Eclipse
could let Aeromarine live at all, and his inference was that I should
shift my enthusiasm over to the Army-type starter.</p>

<p>Patents, I now pointed out, were outside the jurisdiction of the
Engine Section. If Eclipse elected to make trouble for us, that was
their privilege. If, however, they wanted to make our kind of starters,
that was also their privilege. The patent matter could be left to the
courts. I noticed an intent expression on Charley Marcus’s face.</p>

<p>“Commander,” he said quietly, “your approach is new to us and
we may find it difficult to conform at first, but from the point of
view of development and the public interest, it looks so sound to
us, we’ll play the game your way.”</p>

<p>The Eclipse Machine Company did play the game our way. They
developed a new starter for the Lawrance radial, and when, on its
first installation down at Pensacola, it developed the usual bugs, the
company moved most of its shopmen down to the air station and
campaigned the trouble so enthusiastically that they made more
character out of their defects than Aeromarine gained out of its
satisfactory equipment.</p>

<p>When, after several years, the patent matter finally came to trial,
the examiner for the court remarked that he could not recall a similar
case but thought everyone’s interests had been well served, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
result of the Bureau policy, and especially so the interests of the
public.</p>

<p>Another perennial problem was spark plugs. It was almost incredible
how sensitive such little things could be. One might think
that the manufacturers should long ago have discovered all the secrets
of such a simple device, and reduced the product to some degree of
standardization. But everything in aviation was so high-strung, every
device so sensitive, it seemed that just changing one minor dimension
of a standard nut or bolt set in motion a whole chain reaction
of troubles. Pressing always for higher power on lower weight, we
created more and more troubles for ourselves. In this field we came
to lean on the BG plug, and on Roy Hurley, its salesman, who was
responsive to our suggestions and worked hard to improve his
product. Mr. Goldsmith, the proprietor of the company, and a
jewelry manufacturer, had turned to making spark plugs during
World War I and now subordinated his other interests to doing a
good job for aviation.</p>

<p>And so we fired away, searching for better accessories of every
kind—a new fuel pump here, imported from France perhaps by
Jimmy Diamond—a new carburetor there, produced by Stromberg
under the wise direction of Leonard S. Hobbs—a new fuel developed
by competing oil companies and fortified by Ethyl under the direction
of Dr. Graham Edgar, of the Ethyl Corporation, and so on to
cover the whole field. And in the process we began collecting a little
group of sales engineers like Roy Hurley, Luke Hobbs, Tom Fagan,
Ray Lansing, and others, men to whom we passed on the demands of
the operating squadrons and with whom we connived to beat Old
Man Trouble. To facilitate operations, we urged these key technicians
to visit the flying units and get the word at first hand. We
brought them into close contact with George Mead, of Wright,
Arthur Nutt, of Curtiss, and Lionel Woolson, of Packard; and we
keyed them in with our competitors out at McCook Field, so that
we finally had a team of competitive yet cooperative agents, all
working for the cause of dependable and durable power plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>And behind our day-to-day jobs of trouble shooting on the accessory
front, we had the major problem of engine development.
Wright Aero, in order to earn the money with which to carry on
their own experimental and development work, must first generate
a reasonable volume of steady profitable business. This meant that
we, and others, must buy enough airplanes to create the demand
for new engines. But before we could do this, the airplanes must
have been conceived, created, and tested. A number of aircraft
had already been built around the air-cooled radial, among them
the Chance Vought UO and the Curtiss TS, but the total was hardly
impressive. Then Wright got a real break when it found a new home
in Reuben Fleet’s Consolidated Army training plane.</p>

<p>Fleet, a former major in the Army Air Service, had created a
new company up in Buffalo which he called Consolidated Aircraft,
and had designed and built a new type of training plane. Using the
welded-steel tubular construction introduced to the United States
by Anthony Fokker, the Dutch manufacturer, Fleet had created an
airplane that was easy to build, easy to maintain and, more important,
extraordinarily safe. His welded-steel fuselages, unlike the old stick-and-wire
type of the Army Jenny or its Navy counterpart, the
N-9, wouldn’t splinter all to pieces in a crack-up nor punch holes
in the ribs of hapless student aviators. The Army had tested the
plane extensively and with such outstanding success that Fleet felt
impelled to try to sell it to the Navy with obvious advantages to all
parties.</p>

<p>This decision in itself was perhaps indicative of the audacity of one
of aviation’s immortal enterprisers, for none knew better than
Reuben Fleet what the handicaps were; as a former procurement
officer at McCook Field, Fleet had played the old Army-Navy
game hard. And it took a swashbuckler like Fleet to dare intimate
that anything designed for the Army could be worth hell-room
to the Navy. And he probably would not have got to first base either,
save that he had been smart enough to use the air-cooled radial
Wright instead of the war-surplus Hispano engine. The Engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Section, at least, could be expected to favor the adoption of the
Army PT, in order to increase the use of the air-cooled engines.
And Reuben Fleet was right on that score.</p>

<p>But there were formidable obstacles. Naval air training was centered
at the Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, where the N-9 seaplane
was well established as a local favorite. Nearly every pilot in the
Navy had qualified on it and now cherished for it the affection of
a kid for his first pony. In order to keep the ancient aircraft flying,
the station had built up an assembly and repair department manned
entirely by civilians from the town of Pensacola—skilled carpenters,
riggers, and fabric workers, fully competent to overhaul the
stick-and-wire N-9’s. As a matter of fact, they could build them
new from the ground up, and this was where the rub lay. After
an airplane had been washed out in a crack-up, it was supposed to
be stricken from the list, an action that in due course would have absorbed
all the war surplus and led to new construction. But at Pensacola,
there were no washouts. In the local jargon, they just “jacked
up the number plate and built a new airplane under it.”</p>

<p>And so in addition to the natural reluctance of the old-timers to
make a change in type, there was the powerful vested interest of
the Pensacola workmen. This fact, however, was never brought
into the open. It appeared rather that the Consolidated NY had a
nasty flying characteristic, probably inherited from its Army ancestry:
it possessed an “abnormal spin” as compared with the N-9.
If the “good old N-9” lost flying speed and stalled, it whipped suddenly
into a spinning nose dive that would lead to a crash if the pilot
did what came naturally and opened his throttle. If, however, he
“cut the gun” and dived to regain flying speed, he could recover
control. The object of much of the student’s early training was to
get him to disobey that impulse and cut the gun in a spin. This, to
our old-timers, was a “normal spin.”</p>

<p>The trouble with the Consolidated NY was that it was difficult
to make it spin at all, and equally difficult to get it out of a true spin.
The old-timers, passing over the obvious advantage of reluctance
to spin at all, and the priceless benefit of a fuselage that could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
splinter and poke holes in a pilot, now stressed the disadvantages of
the new plane; how could you teach a pilot to get out of a spin
if you couldn’t get him into one? To combat this argument and get
the plane adopted so as to increase production of new Wright air-cooled
engines was the task of the Engine Section. And the cockpit
for the final contest was Admiral Moffett’s corner office and a meeting
of what was called officially a “Bureau conference.” In the course
of several contests here, I had begun to learn some of the ins and outs.</p>

<p>As the heads of divisions and chiefs of sections of BUAERO
flocked into the admiral’s office that morning, each one took up his
position more or less according to rank; that is, with captains and
commanders on the admiral’s right. This suited me because I had
come to learn that the discussion worked downward according to
rank and that sometimes the last fellow to speak might turn the
tide, especially if he could present some reasonable compromise. I
knew, of course, that every man in the room had previously buttonholed
the Old Man in an effort to sell his own bill of goods in
advance, but that the admiral, who knew nothing about engineering
and wanted to know even less, would now stimulate acrimonious
discussion and draw his own conclusions from the discomfiture he
saw on one man’s face or the triumph he observed on another.</p>

<p>And as the contest raged this particular morning, everyone knew
the real issue, including the admiral, but no one mentioned it. Argument
and discussion raged about every irrelevant aspect, but everyone
ducked the matter of Pensacola’s vested interest. After a long
while the admiral turned to me.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t the Engine Section anything to offer?” he asked, well
knowing that of course it had.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” I replied, “I’m afraid we’re too much an interested
party to bear weight here. We think that the adoption of the Consolidated
would lead to faster engine development and that this fact
alone would justify a favorable decision.” The admiral didn’t bat an
eye.</p>

<p>“If you’ve got a suggestion,” he said, “don’t be afraid to let us
have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sir,” I went on, “it seems to me that what this conference
must decide is this: what do we really want to do—train pilots, or
kill them?” There wasn’t a sound in the room. The admiral glanced
from face to face and then stood up.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “if that’s your decision, it’s agreeable
to me. But remember now,” he added, “I’ll expect every officer in
the Bureau to pitch in and make this Consolidated airplane a success.”</p>

<p>As the conferees filed out through the door, I noticed the admiral
watching me and detected the quick jerk of his head that signaled
me to lag behind. He struck a match and took two puffs at his pipe.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot going on around here,” he remarked, using the
very words with which he had received me the morning I reported
to him. “I can’t keep track of all of it,” he added, and then with a
grin that drew down the tight corners of his mouth, “keep your eyes
open. If you see anything you think needs handling, take care of
it, whether or not it comes under your department.”</p>

<p>As we moved toward the door the admiral caught my elbow.</p>

<p>“That fellow Mitchell is on the rampage again,” he said. “The
Army has decided to order him to Texas to get him out of Washington.
But he’ll break out at the worst time, wherever he is.” He struck
another match and took two reflective puffs on his pipe.</p>

<p>“Keep your eye on him,” he concluded, “and be ready to lend a
hand with the counterpublicity.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_SIX">CHAPTER SIX<br>
What the Doctor Ordered</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The “Affair Fleet,” as the celebrated episode of the Consolidated
training plane came to be called in BUAERO, not only marked the
advancement of the Engine Section from the limited environment of
trouble-shooting into the more intricate realms of Bureau politics,
but it also forecast our early graduation into the more creative field
of aircraft engine development. And this important transition dated
from a visit to the Engine Section by an aircraft manufacturer,
Chance Milton Vought, president of the Chance Vought Corporation,
of Long Island City, New York, a man with a waxed moustache
and a fertile brain from which sprang the idea that touched off a
chain reaction destined to alter the whole course of aviation.</p>

<p>Chance Vought was perhaps the most colorful of the unique
personalities who made up the “airplane trade” as differentiated
from the “engine trade.” Unlike Glenn L. Martin, whose tastes then
inclined to rather dressy suits, Chance favored the tweedy look.
With dark hair and eyebrows and his blond moustache, he was our
example of sartorial perfection—except upon certain occasions.</p>

<p>After he had about completed one contract and had begun to feel
the pressing need for another, he would make his appearance in
the Bureau in a dilapidated tweed suit, under a moth-eaten coonskin
coat, wearing a lean and hungry look, and talking very poor.
At least he tried to make his look lean and hungry, but behind the
façade still shone the dapper first-nighter of Keith’s Palace Theatre.
Of course everyone was wise to the act, and since Chance himself
was one of the wisest, he knew they were, and the recurrence of
the cycle of poverty had become a source of amusement tending to
soften up whatever sales resistance might develop.</p>

<p>This was a period of one-man organizations, when a Don Douglas,
a Dutch Kindleberger, a Tony Fokker, or an Igor Sikorsky carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
under the crown of his hat all there was to know about aircraft engineering.
Most of these men dealt with the Design Section, located
in larger quarters up the corridor from the Engine Section, but as
time passed, and especially after the “Affair Fleet,” others like
Claire Egtvedt, of the Boeing Company, out in Seattle, and Chance
Vought began filtering into the Engine Section. And now as Chance
slid through our door, rigged out in his tramp regalia, the Section
gathered around my desk for a little plain and fancy kidding. Although
the room was warm, Chance was too much the showman
to offer to take off the coat. Instead, he posed his question.</p>

<p>“What’s cooking?” he inquired, biting his waxed moustache.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s cooking,” I countered. “In fact, I can report ‘eight
o’clock lights and galley fires out’ like any other good sailor.”</p>

<p>Chance grinned. “I’m running out of work,” he said, “and if I
can’t get a new contract soon I’ll have to close up shop.”</p>

<p>Henry Mullinix shook his head as he put in his oar. “Mr. Vought,”
he said, “you must know that your little UO, once the sweetest little
job in the air, has now become so overloaded it can hardly stagger
off a catapult. Surely you don’t expect the Bureau to buy any more
trucks like that?”</p>

<p>Chance bristled with indignation. “It’s the Bureau’s own fault,”
he snorted. “They’ve added everything to it from automatic toilets
to hot and cold running radios.”</p>

<p>Ricco Botta added his salt to the wound. “It’s still a kluck,” he
said, “no matter how you alibi it.”</p>

<p>As Chance opened his mouth to retort, I gave him the <em>coup de
grâce</em>. “Fact is, you’ve come to the end of your rope. If you want to
do more business with this Bureau,” I concluded, “you may as well
make up your mind to create something new.”</p>

<p>Chance sat silent, fingering his moustache. “Do you really mean
that?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“We’re your friends,” I replied. Chance sat quietly as if debating
his next course, and then, having made up his mind, he sprang a
bombshell.</p>

<p>“All right, my friends,” he said with a smile, “I’ve got a new airplane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
on the boards—one that will set the world on fire. But the
new airplane calls for a new engine; I want three hundred and fifty
real horsepower but on an engine weight of not over 650 pounds.
If the Engine Section will give me that, I’ll give the Bureau the
world’s best airplane.”</p>

<p>The room became very still; all kidding had fled right out the
window. Chance had passed the buck right back to the Engine
Section; he’d written the prescription for a new power plant. And
furthermore we realized he was absolutely right in his choice of
size; the Wright 200 air-cooled, which by now was being called the
“Whirlwind,” was only a zephyr. The Wright 400-hp P-2, later
named the “Cyclone,” was overweight for Chance. Something about
halfway between seemed to be the answer, and Chance had called
the turn. The catapults on the battleships and cruisers, together with
their hoisting gear and other equipment, had been designed to handle
a limited weight, and this, in turn, controlled the size of our new
airplane. The weight of the engine determined the final all-up weight
of the aircraft, and the power output was dictated by the necessity
for getting the plane up to flying speed before it reached the end
of the catapult. And while there was no such limitation on aircraft
carriers, like the new <em>Lexington</em> and <em>Saratoga</em>, then building in the
shipyards, the over-all size of the airplanes would determine the
number each carrier might line up on her flight deck. The Vought
prescription would also lead to a new type of fighter, smaller than
anything around the P-2 but with higher performance.</p>

<p>Better still, Chance Vought’s new engine seemed to lie within the
realm of possibility. The 200-hp Whirlwind had a cylinder volume
of some 800 cubic inches; the bigger Cyclone, at 450 hp, had about
1,650 cubic inches. A Wright engine just between these two might
displace about 1,200 cubic inches, and conceivably be made to
develop 350 horsepower. Chance had put the job up to us and we
would put it up to Wright.</p>

<p>“All right, Chance,” I said soberly enough, “you go on back to
Long Island and start work; we’ll get your engine for you.” Chance
Vought relaxed and grinned back at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” he inquired, “what will I do to keep the shop
open?”</p>

<p>“Go call on Commander Kraus, over in Procurement,” I replied.
“Tell him about this discussion. Maybe he can scrape up an order
for enough UO’s to keep you ticking.”</p>

<p>As soon as Chance had left the room, I telephoned Charlie Lawrance
and Guy Vaughan, of Wright Aero, and asked them to take
the midnight train down for a conference the next day. They were
not too enthusiastic at first, fearing that a completely new engine on
top of their already heavy load might break them down. But we
compromised on a proposal to scale the P-2 model down to about
1,200 inches displacement, without undertaking a completely new
design. This was not so crazy as it might sound, for while you
couldn’t scale an engine up with any hope of success, you could
scale it down if you were willing to accept a few compromises on
weight. We were willing and Wright was agreeable. Thus was
born the Wright R-1200, or Simoon, an engine that, though it never
went into production, still had its impact on naval aviation.</p>

<p>The reason why it never got into production appeared nearly a
year later in the person of Mr. Frederick B. Rentschler, former
president of Wright Aeronautical Corporation, who walked in on
us one morning carrying a dilapidated cowhide brief case and looking
even thinner than when I had first met him on that visit with
Bruce Leighton, a year earlier. I recalled that in his argument with
Leighton over air-cooled versus liquid-cooled he had shown dogged
singleness of purpose and ability to reason logically. He had resigned
from the presidency of Wright Aero shortly afterward, and for
reasons which I had not learned. Now he began to tell me.</p>

<p>It seemed there had been some disagreement on financial policy
between him and Dick Hoyt, chairman of the board. Hoyt had
wanted to declare a dividend out of earnings from the Army contract
for Hispano H engines; Rentschler had insisted on retaining
earnings for investment in engineering development. Finally
Rentschler had resigned. It had been rumored that he and Hoyt had
disagreed over the acquisition by Wright of the Lawrance engine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
but Rentschler now made no reference to this. After his resignation
from Wright he had intended going back to Hamilton, Ohio, to his
father’s foundry business, the firm of Hooven, Owens, Rentschler.
His father had been certain that the aviation business held no future,
but aviation had got into his blood. During a spell in the hospital,
he had made up his mind to stay in the game and had given consideration
to what he might do to help out.</p>

<p>It was his considered opinion that we needed more competition
than we could possibly get under present circumstances. The Curtiss
company had no serious interest in air-cooled engines; on the contrary,
they were committed to liquid-cooled. Wright, he thought,
was unlikely to progress as rapidly as we required, especially under
its present management. He knew the inside thinking of both Curtiss
and Wright, and was certain that an ultimate merger of the two
companies was not an impossibility; as a matter of fact, if the Wright
air-cooled engine got threatening, Curtiss might move toward merger
and control. The import of his remark was not lost on the Engine
Section.</p>

<p>For in taking the decision to support the air-cooled program in
competition with the more advanced liquid-cooled development, we
had counted heavily on competition in private industry as the vital
spark. This merger idea, somewhat new in that era of private initiative,
was of course wholly unexpected by such business amateurs as
then comprised the Engine Section. The threat to our whole air-cooled
program was so immediate, however, that we listened with
rapt attention to our visitor.</p>

<p>He now proposed to organize a company to design and construct
air-cooled aircraft engines for the Bureau. He had interested the
Niles Tool Company in his project, and had their approval to his
taking over certain vacant loft areas in the huge plant of the Pratt
and Whitney Tool Company, of Hartford, Connecticut. That
company, having expanded its facilities to meet excess demands in
World War I, now rented the extra space for use as a tobacco warehouse.
He had received assurances as to the necessary capital; Pratt
and Whitney had idle funds it could advance to a new enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
willing to rent its excess facilities. The company had extra machine
tools and trained supervision and Hartford was a fine labor market
for the machinists and craftsmen so necessary for precise aircraft-engine
production. He proposed to select a small group of the most
experienced engineers and production men in the business and to
build around this nucleus the best organization in aviation. Competition
from such a group would give the Navy the superior engines
it so badly needed.</p>

<p>As Rentschler completed his airtight proposal, I was struck by
the sheer logic of his presentation. He’d apparently thought it all
through and made himself letter perfect. But there was one big drawback
which I now pointed out to him.</p>

<p>We would welcome competition, but current appropriations
would hardly support Wright Aeronautical, let alone a new company.
We had tried to make such progress through good leadership
as might approximate the benefits of strong competition, and had so
far succeeded fairly well. Wright Aeronautical had spared no efforts
to make dependable air-cooled engines, but Curtiss had not been
pushing their R-1454. This had left us with but one source of supply
and made us vulnerable to criticism by Congressional investigation,
which might charge us with supporting a monopoly. This took us
into the field of policy, which was the province of the chief of Bureau,
so we decided that perhaps we had best put the proposal before him.</p>

<p>When we were ushered into the admiral’s sunny corner office,
I noticed a newspaperman, George S. Wheat, sitting in one of the
easy chairs. Quite a crony of the admiral’s, he had worked for Wright
Aeronautical back in the period when Rentschler had been its president.
I now associated him, therefore, with Wright, and was somewhat
surprised when he made no move to leave the room. It didn’t
occur to me at the time that he might be a part of Rentschler’s approach
to the subject of the new company, and I didn’t learn the
facts until years later. Then George confessed that Rentschler, prior
to invading my office, had inquired about the new chief of the Engine
Section, and that George had described me as an opinionated
somebody who apparently knew where he was going. But in Admiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Moffett’s office that morning, suspecting no connection between
the two men, I plunged into my statement.</p>

<p>The admiral listened attentively until I had finished and then made
a quick decision.</p>

<p>“This Bureau,” he began, “is wide open to criticism for supporting
an engine monopoly. We know it isn’t so, but that won’t prevent
our being smeared by headlines. I realize we haven’t the necessary
appropriations, but you leave that to me; I’ll wangle them out
of Congress. If you can work out anything reasonable with these
men, go ahead; I’ll approve whatever you recommend.”</p>

<p>As I turned to go, the admiral called me back. Some time earlier
he had instructed me to prepare a statement for his presentation to
a Congressional committee in support of his proposal to junk the
war-surplus Liberties and Hispanos and buy new engines. I had given
him a rather technical treatise, pointing out the superior aerodynamic
performance to be had with the new engines. This he had promptly
tossed back in my lap with a remark that Congress had no interest
in performance; they wanted to save cash. Now that incident came
to his mind and he inquired if I had made any progress.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I replied, “I’ve looked up the records and found that
it costs about a thousand dollars to convert an old Liberty into one
incorporating all the new changes. After that we can get seventy-five-hours
flying time out of it before we have to put in another
converted one. For three hundred hours flying time, we spend four
thousand dollars on conversions. Meanwhile we can get a new
Wright Whirlwind for about the same money and run it for three
hundred hours without overhaul.” The admiral smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s more like it,” he said. “Even I can understand that kind of
engineering, and so can a Congressman. It’s cheaper to scrap junk
than try to save it!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” the admiral smiled, as he waved us out the door, “see
if you can dream up something like that on this new engine.”</p>

<p>When our party returned to the Engine Section, we gathered
once more around my desk. Rentschler asked what size engine we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
thought he should build and I gave him the background of the
Wright R-1200 Simoon, especially the basis on which Chance
Vought had written the prescription. However, I intimated, Wright
had been working on that nearly a year and might have a prohibitive
head start.</p>

<p>Rentschler wasn’t so sure; Wright had a heavy load with two
new engines and the task of developing the third, the Whirlwind. A
good engineering outfit, with no production problems and only one
project, ought go places; starting off with a clean sheet of paper
and no commitments as to old tools or techniques, they might even
have the advantage. But they must be sure of their basic design principles.
The Wright R-1200, a scaled-down P-2, would suffer certain
handicaps inherent in the process; the new engine might generate
the 350 horsepower on less weight.</p>

<p>It looked to me as though they should try the other way around.
Keeping the 650-pound weight Chance had specified, they might
put their advantage into greater power. Any airplane man would
snap at this advantage and thus become an ally. Furthermore, it
seemed to me, if by clever design the new company could build
more cylinder capacity into the engine and still keep the specified
weight, and if by cylinder refinement they could take out more
power for each cubic inch of displacement, they might gain an
outstanding advantage. This, in turn, might compensate for some
of the time advantage Wright had already gained.</p>

<p>This idea seemed to enlist just a tinge of enthusiasm from Rentschler,
who was most serious and calculating. Doing a job seemed a
fetish with him and he lacked humor where business was concerned.
He moved now to the question of an experimental contract.
Since we had given one to Wright Aero for the R-1200 Simoon, he
presumed, of course, we would do as much for him.</p>

<p>This was a matter on which I had to throw cold water. Wright,
I informed Rentschler, was a going concern complete with management,
production facilities, engineering, and experience. His new
company was still but a figment of his own imagination and I could
not recommend to Kraus that he risk public funds in support of anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
so ephemeral. Admiral Moffett had earlier obtained an appropriation
of $90,000 from Congress for an experimental engine.
The best I could do for Rentschler was to earmark the fund and
hold it in reserve for his project. If he built an engine that fulfilled
our requirements, the fund would be available to help compensate
him; after that the engine would stand on the same basis as the
Wright—the best job would take the business.</p>

<p>After this statement, Rentschler sat a long while in thought. I
could see he was greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said finally, “if that’s the way it is, that’s the way it is,
but I think you’re pretty tough with me.”</p>

<p>I didn’t agree with him. The moment a contractor accepted a contract
with the government he was obliged to grant his customer some
control over the project. Such a division of authority was bound to
slow a development and might even compromise its integrity. But as
long as the contractor risked only his own money, then he had full
authority over how he spent it, and no one could interfere. Furthermore,
in this case, time was of the essence even more than usual, and
when a contractor is wasting his own money and time, he is less
complacent about it than if it belongs to Uncle Sam. The medicine
might look bitter to Rentschler, but in the long run it must prove
more effective. And more important than all, the moment he began
risking his own funds for our advantage we inherited a moral responsibility
to give him every reasonable assistance—and this we
did.</p>

<p>From that date forward, Rentschler made it a point to visit the
Bureau from week to week to keep us advised of progress. His first
surprise was the news that he had collected a small group of men,
mostly drawn from Wright Aero, as the nucleus of his organization;
and he had shown rare judgment in picking the ablest of them. There
was Don Brown from the shop, Andy Willgoos and George Mead
from engineering, Jack Borrup and Charles Marks on the tooling
side, and so on, to include upwards of a dozen really competent men.
The impact on Wright Aero would prove severe and replacements
would be hard to find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>George Mead arrived in Washington early in June on a day when
my wife and I had planned to run over to Annapolis for the June
Week exercises—we had first met there and loved the little town.
Going back and forth in the car, George and I first discussed the design
principles for the new engine. Of course the enclosed valve gear
and rotary induction of the R-1454 were musts, but we rejected that
engine’s arrangement of accessories on the front end; we would
tuck ours on the rear out of the salt spray. We would split the crankshaft
in two pieces, as George had done on an earlier engine, and
would divide the crankcase similarly. As we talked, George sketched
the ideas on the back of an envelope and captioned them in his precise
printed letters. Later, we found some of our principles had already
been used in the British Bristol Jupiter, but for the moment
we glowed with the enthusiasm of creators of a new art.</p>

<p>Later, as the summer wore on and our engine problems eased up,
storm clouds appeared in another quarter. The Engine Section had
as one of its problems the Packard installation in the rigid airship
<em>Shenandoah</em>. Lighter-than-air had always been the admiral’s pet
hobby and we had spent a lot of effort on two jobs: preventing the
cooling water from freezing, and recovering water from the engine
exhaust to compensate for the expenditure of fuel. This, in turn,
avoided the need for valving precious helium gas—a critical factor
in lighter-than-air.</p>

<p>The chief engineer of the <em>Shenandoah</em>, Edgar W. Sheppard, was
an extremely able young lieutenant, who had served as my Number
Two at Great Lakes, and who now spent considerable time with us.
From him I learned disturbing things about the Naval Air Station
at Lakehurst, headquarters for the rigids <em>Shenandoah</em> and <em>Los
Angeles</em>.</p>

<p>In response to the criticism Billy Mitchell had leveled at the Navy,
the Chief of Naval Operations had scheduled a number of western
flights in the <em>Shenandoah</em> for public relations purposes. Prominent
people and news writers had already been taken on junkets, but the
expedition scheduled for late August and early September seemed
correlated with the country fairs all over the West—and just at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
peak of thunderstorm activity. If there was one thing a lighter-than-air
pilot disliked, it was thunderstorms—and for good reason. But
the pilots had not dared make public confession of their fear, lest
they betray a weakness of lighter-than-air that might retard its development.
And so they gritted their teeth and tried to suppress the
jitters that kept them all on edge.</p>

<p>And now, as the <em>Shenandoah</em> departed on her fateful cruise, all
of us in BUAERO followed her with anxious hearts. Suddenly a
telegram sent from a town in Ohio by one of her crew brought
shocking news of one of the greatest disasters in history. Turbulent
currents of a line squall had sheared the girders of the great
silver ship and split her into three sections. Parts had been free-ballooned
to safety, but many of the crew had lost their lives, among
them Edgar Sheppard. The ship had broken under his feet; in falling
he had seized a girder and held on, 6,000 feet in the air. One of
his men, hanging on precariously nearby, had called to him. When
Shep extended the helping hand, his own girder failed and he fell to
his death. There had been no parachutes. The whole Bureau was
stunned.</p>

<p>And then lightning struck in another place. From down in San
Antonio, Texas, where Brig. Gen. William G. Mitchell, USA, had
been exiled to keep him quiet, newspaper headlines trumpeted
charges at both the Army and Navy—charges of “treasonable neglect.”
The front-page news struck the public like a clap of thunder,
and the battle for the separate air force was on in earnest. In
BUAERO the whole staff rallied around Admiral Moffett, and
embers that had so long smoldered now flamed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_SEVEN">CHAPTER SEVEN<br>
Calvin Coolidge’s Town Meeting</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Billy Mitchell, handsome, dynamic, fast on the draw, and breathing
the spirit of the offensive, personified the knight of the air of
World War I. An outstanding pilot, a bold horseman, a soldier’s
soldier, a courageous crusader, he was the newsman’s dream of dramatic
copy. And now he assumed the lead in public opinion with
the same <em>sang froid</em> he had displayed flying Number One of the
First American Air Force on its first flight over the St. Mihiel Salient.
With a fine sense of timing, he did that thing which every American
longs to do—he told off his superiors in no uncertain terms, and with
such sheer audacity that he almost got away with it. The public supported
him from the start; it looked like a sure thing for his independent
air force. Save for certain strategic errors, he would have
won in a glide.</p>

<p>By seizing upon the crash of the great rigid airship <em>Shenandoah</em>
as his take-off signal, Mitchell accepted the risk attendant upon
hitting the Navy while it was down. And since lighter-than-air craft
had become the personal hobby, and public responsibility, of Rear
Adm. William A. Moffett, Mitchell made an implacable enemy of
a man who, in the public mind, was no less devoted to the cause of
aviation than Mitchell himself. And so, when Bill Mitchell sang out,
“Tally Ho!” and started his power dive on Billy Moffett’s tail, he
suddenly found himself in a dogfight with an opponent quite as
wiley as the famous German Baron von Richthofen. Even this was
a calculated risk and might not have brought Mitchell down. It was
Mitchell’s attack on the Army that made him vulnerable. For while
the Army might view with tolerant amusement Mitchell’s assault
on the Navy, it could not countenance insubordination in its own
ranks; mutiny is inherently an unpardonable sin. Mitchell may have
made a fatal error in not resigning his commission before charging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
his seniors with “treasonable neglect.” By such action he could
have martyred himself in the public eye and at the same time avoided
the court-martial that finally convicted him without having to let
the independent-air-force issue influence the trial. As it was, certain
of his seniors, notably the then Chief of Staff, Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, who would one day use the Air Force to gain victory in
the Pacific, seemed at the time fairly to lick their chops as they assembled
to convict General Mitchell.</p>

<p>Over on the Navy side were many naval aviators who had suffered
the same frustrations that had aroused Mitchell to a frenzy
against the Army. Feeling themselves hamstrung by naval conservatism,
they too believed their only hope for advancing their beloved
aviation lay in a new deal all around. But steeped as they all
were in the ancient tradition of the West Point-Annapolis football
feud, their first reaction was to defend their Navy, and the second
was to rally around their chief, Admiral Moffett. For General
Mitchell to expect aid from them under the circumstances would
have been something like a Hatfield trying to induce a McCoy to
join up on a squirrel shoot, while the feudin’ and the fightin’ were at
a climax. As it was, Admiral Moffett kept his hotheads in line, including
a few who openly favored the separate air force.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mitchell’s quick kick took the Navy high command
completely by surprise. And as the political football sailed end over
end toward the Navy goal, the only receiver ready was Admiral
Moffett. A good open-field runner himself, he was about to take the
ball over his shoulder on the dead run and might have sped to a
touchdown save that his teammates blocked him out. The Navy
strategists decided not to dignify Mitchell with any public recognition;
they would just refuse to play.</p>

<p>But in BUAERO, every typewriter began tapping out retaliatory
releases for the admiral. In spite of urgings by the latter, the Secretary
staunchly refused to comment on the Mitchell attack, even as the
press clamored for a reply. It was not until several days had passed
that the admiral finally succeeded in drawing a reluctant consent
to his own response. Then permission was granted only with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
express condition that the admiral should reply on his own account
and own responsibility.</p>

<p>Approval came at noon on a Saturday. By then the Bureau had
closed for the day and, in addition to the admiral, only two of us
remained aboard. One was the admiral’s faithful colored messenger,
Brown, the other, myself. We were waiting for the admiral in the
anteroom to his office when he steamed through the door under full
power. On the desk lay a copy of a statement I had drawn up for
him. Seizing this, the admiral scrawled across the bottom a blunt
postscript, calling William Mitchell a liar and ascribing his recent
charges either to hallucinations or delusions of grandeur.</p>

<p>I cut the mimeograph stencil for him on his secretary’s typewriter.
Brown ran off the copies on a machine across the hall. The admiral
waited impatiently until they were done, and then, seizing me by the
arm, hustled me out of the building and into my car. We drove uptown
to the offices of the Associated and United Press, where the
admiral himself handed his statement across the counter to astonished
reporters.</p>

<p>The statement hit the front pages of the New York papers. Its
publication released all the ancient grudges and conflicts in aviation
dating as far back as World War I. The old “airplane scandal” was
dragged out and dusted off by crank inventors, claiming they had
been robbed of their patents. The cry of “air trust” echoed through
the halls of Congress and counsels of investigating committees, scenting
headlines, began trying to get into the act.</p>

<p>Up to that moment some twenty-odd inquiries had been held on
what to do about aviation. With surprising agreement they had all
supported certain concrete recommendations; without exception
they had been promptly consigned to the ninth pigeonhole—the
one next the wastebasket. In 1924, during the excitement over the
controversy between the proponents of the airplane and the supporters
of the battleship, a Congressional committee, under the
chairmanship of Congressman Lampert, had found that aviation,
instead of being stifled by a “trust” was dying of neglect. The United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
States lacked both a policy for aviation and the legislation necessary
to implement it.</p>

<p>The new controversy revived the ancient cry of “profiteer”
against manufacturers, already reduced to hungry remnants of a
once highly productive group. These now got together in their
aeronautical chamber of commerce and sent a delegation to call on
the Secretaries of War and Navy to urge that the two departments
join in requesting the President to appoint a presidential advisory
commission to look into the whole question. At the invitation of the
President himself, they later went to the White House to support
this recommendation. The President, who had always shown a
Yankee sense of orderliness and a willingness to accept responsibility
for the conduct of his administration, had been disturbed by the
unseemly brawl. He now made no attempt to deny Mitchell the
privilege of stating his case to the public, but since the charges
reflected upon his own administration, he accepted the industry’s
proposal as a good way to sift them out. He approved the idea of a
sort of New England town meeting on aviation.</p>

<p>His first step was to summon his wise and good friend, Dwight
Morrow, and his second was to invite him to head up the inquiry.
He then selected a group of men whose standing would warrant
public support but was careful not to include anyone who had an ax
to grind. The Commission included men from civil life who possessed
knowledge of aviation, men from Congress who had had experience
in the field, and men from the Army and Navy whose
judgment would command public respect and confidence as did
that of all other members.</p>

<p>Two of the members, Howard Coffin and William F. Durant, were
engineers. From the armed forces were drawn Maj. Gen. James
G. Harbord and Adm. Frank J. Fletcher, both retired after distinguished
public careers. From Congress came three men, Senator
Hiram Bingham, of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, himself
a military aviator; James S. Parker, of the House Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce; and Congressman Carl Vinson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of the House Committee on Naval Affairs, a Democrat and a man
destined to play a statesman’s role in the nation’s security. With
Circuit Judge Arthur C. Dennison, Dwight Morrow, the chairman,
completed a compact panel well constituted for the task in
hand.</p>

<p>The Morrow Board held numerous public sessions and heard over
a hundred witnesses present a wide assortment of views and opinions.
Against the background of the Mitchell charges, the hearings received
public attention and were widely discussed in editorial
columns. Comment by the press was strongly favorable to the
Mitchell cause and to all outward appearances, the general seemed
on the way to victory. Behind the scenes, the Morrow Board studied
the many records of previous inquiries, and by sifting them carefully
was able to bring its own investigation to a close in about ninety days.</p>

<p>Over in BUAERO, we burned the midnight oil preparing the
admiral’s testimony. The spadework consisted in assembling the
answers to specific questions propounded by the Morrow Board.
Such questions were farmed out to different branches of the Bureau
and then assembled for final study. Final editing of these comments
fell to Lieutenant Commander Du Bose and myself but the larger
issues were debated all over the Bureau. The interested parties were
pretty well consolidated in opposition to the independent-air-force
proposal, but they were divided almost equally on another organization
question: should the admiral favor the formation of a corps
of aviators, generally similar to the highly regarded United States
Marine Corps?</p>

<p>In support of this idea, many of the old-timers worked hard on
the admiral right up to the night before the Old Man was scheduled
to appear before the Board. Then as we gathered around the long
table for his final decisions, with that important subject all that
remained to be agreed upon, I put it up to the admiral.</p>

<p>“Sir,” I said, “here is a question that can’t be straddled.”</p>

<p>The admiral twisted nervously in his chair. Strong pressure had
been brought to bear on him by the leading old-timers, men whose
friendship he regarded highly, and, politician that he was, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
have given almost anything to be able to accommodate them. But
underneath this issue lay certain fundamentals on which he had
strong convictions.</p>

<p>He had gone to sea in the old days when the Engineer Corps
and the line officers had fought so bitterly in the ancient feud between
the “black gang” and the “deck force” that the service had
been shaken to its foundations. As the only way out of an impossible
situation, the Department had finally amalgamated the conflicting
forces by absorbing the engineers into the line. The admiral, recognizing
the need for specialization, was firmly convinced that it should
be had without putting the specialists in a separate corps where
corps loyalties might transcend loyalty to the service. Now he had
to face that issue alone; there could be no agreement within his
Bureau and this time he could not induce them to persuade him to
do what he wanted.</p>

<p>“You are all my friends,” he said, lifting his hand in a gesture to
include all present, “and I’m sorry not to go along with some of
you. The young pilots,” he added, “will think I’ve let them down.
But the time will come when they will thank me.” He paused, and
then with greater earnestness than I had ever heard in his voice, he
concluded, “I’d rather see those kids dead than inflict on them the misery
I suffered along with everyone else in the old days of deck force
versus black gang.”</p>

<p>Suddenly his face brightened as he said with a smile, “Hell, we
won’t secede from the Navy. If we are half as good as we think we
are, we’ll take it over!” Years later, when “Duke” Ramsey, Forrest
Sherman, and Arthur Radford, some of his “boys,” occupied the seats
of the mighty, I recalled this comment.</p>

<p>Next morning, while the admiral testified at the hearings, I sat
at my desk in the Engine Section, trying to concentrate on neglected
paper work. But up there in that committee room, decisive
events were taking place. The admiral was not impressive on the
witness stand of a formal hearing; his strength lay in the give and
take of the informal conference. He had little patience with the
measured logic of a man like Fred Rentschler; though his own conclusions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
might derive from similar processes, his brain acted like
chain lightning. What looked like snap judgment might have been
thought through, but he was too impatient to develop the process
for others. Now he would be sitting up there before a solemn board,
facing a press table of partisan commentators sold on the Mitchell
doctrine, and surrounded by all the high dignitaries of the Navy
Department, from Secretary Wilbur and Admiral Hughes, the
Chief of Naval Operations, down to Bureau chiefs like himself, most
of whom feared he might sell out the Navy and go over to the
Mitchell side.</p>

<p>For this had been a trying period for the Navy. Following the
Armistice, public opinion had favored the idea of peace through
disarmament and the Limitation of Arms Conference had all but
emasculated the service. Then the spectacular air attacks engineered
by General Mitchell had put the Navy further on the defensive. No
one in the high command had developed a flair for public relations
and now with Billy Mitchell on the offensive, the Navy had its
back against the wall. Much of the enmity aroused by Mitchell’s
attack now turned inward to BUAERO and even Admiral Moffett.
Yet up there before the Morrow Board, if the Old Man would just
stick to his testimony as we had written it and not start ad-libbing,
he would come out all right. If, however, he deviated it, some hawk
like Congressman Carl Vinson, of Georgia, one of the best informed
men in Congress, would dive on him at terminal speed.</p>

<p>Then, a little before noon, the admiral himself walked into the
Engine Section and slumped down in his chair. All jauntiness was
gone; he looked tired.</p>

<p>“They tell me I made a mess of it,” he said simply.</p>

<p>It seemed that when he had taken his stand against the independent
air force, Secretary Wilbur and others smiled their relief. The newspaper
men looked let down. Then on the subject of the air corps,
when Congressman Vinson cross-questioned him, he had, as an
afterthought, stated that his Bureau should have control of aviation
personnel and operations as well as matériel. Quick as a flash, Vinson
shot back, “So you do believe in the air corps after all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>In the subsequent confusion, the admiral had not made his position
clear, but had left the matter in a snarl. Even as he finished his
jerky report, the telephone rang. It was Marvin MacIntyre, a newspaper
reporter who frequently dropped into the Bureau for a story
and who had become one of the admiral’s cronies. Years later, during
the Roosevelt Administration, Mac sat in the White House as Secretary
to the President, but back in those days he was just a good
leg man.</p>

<p>“What happened at the hearing?” he inquired. “It looked to the
press as though the Old Man had something on his chest but, with
all that rank around him, got hemmed in.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I replied, anxious to keep the admiral’s standing.</p>

<p>“But that break with Vinson made him look bad,” Mac wailed.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why,” I replied. “All it meant was that he should
have a bigger voice in personnel and operations but with a little
topside cooperation, he doesn’t need an air corps for that.” The
admiral nodded vigorously. Mac shouted over the phone.</p>

<p>“Sure, sure, I get you. Good-by!”</p>

<p>With that the admiral departed, his head up, his step springy. But
we weren’t yet out of the overcast.</p>

<p>Next morning a group of us sat in Jerry Land’s tiny office attending
a conference called by the head of the Matériel Division. Bureau
business had all but ceased during the inquiry and even now we
could not get down to brass tacks. Now a civilian walked right into
the conference and brought our discussion to an abrupt halt. It was
C. M. Keyes, president of the Curtiss Airplane and Motor Company,
and a leader of the aircraft industry. The separate-air-force controversy
had agitated them too; many companies favored it, especially
those doing business with the Army. Navy contractors either
disapproved or kept mum. Clem Keyes, who now stood in our midst,
had favored the program.</p>

<p>“It looks like the Morrow Board will not recommend the separate
air force,” he said. “But there is one thing they will approve, and
there’s nothing you fellows can do about it.” He then went on to
say that he would appear for the industry at an early session and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
that he would support the idea of a government agency to be charged
with responsibility for and authority over the design, development,
and procurement of all aircraft, whether for the Army, Navy, or
civil uses.</p>

<p>The news took my breath, for the thing we feared worst after the
separate air force was unified procurement supply and design. Admiral
Moffett had taken a strong position against it, but if the industry
supported the Army on that, then the Board might accept
it as a compromise. The only thing left for us to do was to block
such a recommendation. While Keyes went on to support the
proposal, I slid out the door and down to the Engine Section.</p>

<p>Here I put in a call for Fred Rentschler, in Hartford. I knew that
some weeks earlier, Kraus in Procurement had informally agreed
to Pratt and Whitney’s proceeding with the purchase of a lot of
tools and materials against a contract then being negotiated, and
that Pratt and Whitney had already committed itself in advance in
the interest of saving time and money. When I heard Fred’s voice
on the phone, I told him about Keyes’s visit and suggested that
he might reconsider his advance purchase order; I doubted that
Admiral Moffett would sign a contract now for the new engines,
since the industry proposed a new agency to do all its buying. I
did not pretend to read the admiral’s mind, and was talking unofficially,
but thought he should be aware of this possibility.</p>

<p>It didn’t take Rentschler long to get the point. Within an hour he
had been in touch with Chance Vought, Grover Loening, Bill Boeing,
and others who had taken similar risks. And when, next day, Mr.
Keyes appeared before the Morrow Board to speak as the sole
representative of the industry, Chairman Morrow advised him that
there had been a change of plan. So many industry members had
asked to address the committee that he could allow Mr. Keyes but
a reduced period and that period had now expired. Meanwhile the
admiral knew nothing of my action and the industry members who
looked to the Bureau for business were not talking.</p>

<p>And while we sweated out the hearings, Admiral Moffett moved
on another front. None appreciated better than he the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
public opinion on the whole controversy, and he had found much
to worry about in the approval given the Mitchell proposal in the
public press. He had, therefore, suggested to George Wheat, now
Fred Rentschler’s public relations counsel, that he would like to
meet the editorial writers and especially the aviation writers of
the metropolitan dailies in New York at an informal dinner where
he could talk with them, and he invited me to go along.</p>

<p>The dinner, held in a private dining room of the old Waldorf
Hotel, started out being a bit stuffy with the natural suspicions engendered
in newspaper men by industrialists giving away free food,
but Admiral Moffett broke the ice with some delightful personal
reminiscences, among them the intimate details of how he outsmarted
Billy Mitchell at the Washington Limitation of Arms Conference
and won the German rigid airship <em>Los Angeles</em> for the Navy. Then
as things loosened up, one of the newswriters put the very question
he wanted, by asking why we opposed the idea of unified procurement,
supply, and design. To the layman, this looked like a natural
way to avoid duplication of effort, to prevent competitive bidding
between the Army and Navy for the same products and generally
reduce expenses.</p>

<p>The admiral warmed to the subject. He recalled that he had once
had that idea and had investigated a few successful business enterprises
in the effort to find out how they handled it. He had found his
answer at General Motors. If any group could have effected important
economies by central purchasing, it would seem to be that
corporation. To his surprise, the several divisions of General Motors
had been decentralized and given complete autonomy. Matter of fact,
that had turned out to be the basic policy that had made the corporation
successful. G.M. divisions had been encouraged to compete
among themselves. No single all-powerful executive had been given
the job of deciding things. Instead, General Motors’ customers made
all the decisions. The financial statements of the several divisions
were good barometers of the effectiveness of their management.
The customer was always right.</p>

<p>Now, the admiral continued, with each G.M. division held responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
for its own performance, common sense dictated that its
officers must have full authority over the tools and materials required
to discharge that responsibility. Control of purchasing was
one of the first requirements. Automotive line production called
for split-second scheduling of material receipts, and this could not
be surrendered to some independent agency without danger of breakdown.
Besides, while central purchasing might appear to reduce
cost through volume purchases, competition between the divisions
might do at least as well without endangering deliveries. That was
all theory, but obviously a company like G.M., in which central
purchasing might appear particularly attractive theoretically, must
have come to their decision to decentralize after experience.</p>

<p>Next day, on the train back to Washington, I felt depressed by
the almost universal acceptance of the Mitchell plan. Even though
the Morrow Board were to turn it down, public opinion would ultimately
force its acceptance. The admiral, however, was most cheerful.
He thought that if he now had just one man in the Bureau, he
could turn the whole thing to his advantage. The man he had in
mind was Capt. Henry C. Mustin, a pioneer naval aviator who had
died in the service. Henry Mustin, he said, was one of the few men
in aviation who combined vision and imagination with practical
judgment. It was the latter quality that Mitchell lacked; Mustin
had had them all. Before he died he had drawn up a detailed plan
for the organization of naval aviation. He had sketched the big carriers
with their squadrons flying overhead, their spare planes on
deck and the personnel listed down to the last ordinary seaman.
That sketch now lay in his safe in BUAERO. When we got back
there, I was to get hold of Du Bose, his Financial Division head, and
help work out estimates of the cost of creating such a force. We
should spread this over a five-year period—make a five-year procurement
program for naval aviation.</p>

<p>“And,” he summed it up, “don’t figure too close. Use your imagination.”</p>

<p>When, finally, the long-awaited report of the Morrow Board
was published, it came as a distinct letdown to many. The advocates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of the independent air force let out loud wails of “whitewash,” and
the press reflected its disappointment. However, in BUAERO there
was satisfaction. The Board rejected the idea of the separate air
force at that time. It did, however, recommend an Air Corps status
for the Army Air Services, something quite compatible with the
Army organization’s several branches such as Infantry, Field Artillery,
Cavalry, Engineers, Coast Artillery, and so on. The report
made separate recommendations for reorganization of the Army and
Navy, which would later be enacted into law in the Air Corps Act
of 1926. It referred to the need for waiving the requirement for
competitive bidding in cases where the public interest required it,
a provision that was later so garbled in the Air Corps Act that it became
quite impossible to procure aircraft at all without violating the
law.</p>

<p>The Board especially turned thumbs down on the British plan of
an air ministry charged with responsibility for both military and
civil aviation. It took a strong position for the principle that historic
American tradition called for armed forces for defense only, and
it insisted they should be kept subordinate to the civil government.
However, it urged the orderly expansion of air transport, preferably
under private management and, to promote the orderly development
of civil aviation, it recommended the establishment of a bureau
of air commerce in the Department of Commerce, then under Secretary
Herbert Hoover. It further recommended the appointment of
an additional assistant secretary of commerce for air, to supervise
the new bureau.</p>

<p>The Board recommended a policy of continuity of orders for
the aircraft industry and proposed a standard rate of replacement
of operating aircraft in order to retain a healthy industry. This, it
pointed out, must become the nucleus of rapid wartime expansion
and should be administered as a continuing source of technological
leadership.</p>

<p>If the report proved lacking in sensationalism, it was none the
less constructive. If now it could be implemented it might become
the Magna Charta of American aviation. President Coolidge transmitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the report to Congress with his own approval and thus started
it on its way to being translated into the Air Commerce Act and the
Air Corps Act of 1926. These acts, in effect, placed the responsibility
for promoting aviation directly upon the shoulders of the government.
They made it the duty of those in authority to promote the
orderly development of the air forces, our air commerce, and our
aircraft industry; and thus, for the first time, enunciated a clear
statement of United States air policy.</p>

<p>As for General Mitchell, whose charges had led to the formulation
of this policy, he was tried by Army general court-martial and
convicted of violation of the ninety-sixth Article of War. He was
sentenced to be suspended from rank, command, and duty, with
forfeiture of all pay and allowances for five years. President Coolidge
modified the forfeiture of pay and accepted the general’s resignation,
to take effect February 1, 1926. Just ten years later, Billy
Mitchell died. But one day the United States Congress did create
a separate air force, and by then, General Mitchell’s name had been
firmly established in his countrymen’s minds as a man who had been
martyred for his vision.</p>

<p>During the last decade of General Mitchell’s life, Admiral Moffett
served continuously as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, and
there founded the technology of naval aviation. It has been said of
the contributions of the two men that “Bill Mitchell’s fumble set
up the play from which Billy Moffett went on to score.” Just at
the peak of his career, the admiral gave his own life to his country
in the crash of the rigid airship <em>Akron</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_EIGHT">CHAPTER EIGHT<br>
Dwight Morrow Advances the Throttle</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The Morrow Board policy, for all its wisdom, might have lapsed
easily into innocuous desuetude save for the dynamic character of
William A. Moffett. Whereas the Army Air Service proclaimed it
a whitewash and a denial of their aspirations, the admiral recognized
it for what it was, a golden opportunity. And as usual, when it came
to capitalizing it, his timing was precise.</p>

<p>I was sitting behind my desk in the Engine Section one morning
engaged in shoveling the avalanche of papers from “Incoming” to
“Outgoing” and feeling much like a fireman on the floor plates of
a coal-burning destroyer under forced draft shoveling coal into the
insatiable maws of a pair of boilers, when the phone rang.</p>

<p>“This is Moffett,” came the admiral’s voice. “I want you to get
hold of Du Bose right away. Grab a taxi and come up here to The
Hill. You’ll find me in Congressman Butler’s office, Chairman of
the Naval Affairs Committee. Bring that estimate on the cost of the
Mustin plan. Got it?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Change that!” came the staccato bark. “Tell
Du Bose to bring the plan. You call up Marvin MacIntyre; tell him
to come to the Bureau. Then you write up a news release for him—one
like this: ‘The greatest forward step in the history of aviation
was taken today when Congressman Butler, Chairman of the House
Naval Affairs Committee, announced approval of the Moffett five-year
Naval Aviation building program.’”</p>

<p>“Did he really approve it, Admiral?” I interposed.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” came the reply. “He hasn’t even seen it. But
when he reads his name in the afternoon <cite>Star</cite> and looks at the editorial
Mac will get for us, he’ll think he invented it himself. Shake
a leg now, and send Du Bose on the run.”</p>

<p>“How did you work it, sir?” I insisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“At the hearing this morning,” the admiral explained, “Butler
was fit to be tied—said the public was clamoring for action on aviation
and wanted to know what to do. I told him he ought to approve
my five-year program. He wanted to know what it was. I told him
the program I’d been trying to sell him for five years. When I’d
ask Congress for money, they’d say ‘where are your men to man
these planes?’ When I’d ask BUNAV for the men, they’d want to
know where the planes were. Butler got all excited and sent me out
of the hearing to get the plan.”</p>

<p>The Moffett five-year building program went through Congress
with a whoop and a holler, and within a week the Army had one of
its own. With this final consummation of the recommendations of
most of the twenty-two inquiries that had investigated aviation, the
throttle was opened at last. This was true in spite of the fact that in
writing the Air Corps Act of 1926, Congress had crossed up the aircraft
industry. The manufacturers, having been promised relaxation
of the competitive-bidding requirement which had served to
hamper research and development, had in turn agreed to a provision
in the Act under which the Armed Forces could audit their accounts
and thus control profits. This was a privilege heretofore never conceded
by private industry, but Congress, lacking the nerve to go
through with the agreement in committee, had so garbled the language
of the Act and so complicated the procedure that no procurement
officer could buy anything without violating some law. However,
public support of the policy had been so evident that the more
courageous procurement people, like our own Sidney Kraus, were
willing to accept the risk.</p>

<p>And so it seemed that almost overnight, aviation, released of its
tie-downs and wheel blocks, became airborne again. In BUAERO
a significant event was the completion of the first Pratt and Whitney
Wasp on December 24, 1926, just six months after its inception.
George had sent me a photograph of the new engine as a Christmas
card and it was a thing of beauty that was to become literally a joy
forever. It came out at exactly the 650 pounds Chance Vought had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
specified but on block test turned up a nice 415 horsepower instead
of the 350 he had asked for.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Wright Simoon also passed its tests at 350 horsepower
though it was already outmoded by the Wasp. In order to
give the Simoon the full benefits of an airplane designed to utilize
the engine’s qualities, Wright had put Hugh Chatfield to work
on the design and construction of their own single-seat fighter called
the “Apache.” On flight test the little craft had shown a performance
far superior to the current liquid-cooled pursuit, even in the controversial
characteristic of high speed at sea level where, according
to the critics, the air-cooled would always be at a serious disadvantage
because of its “large frontal area.”</p>

<p>Since that airplane would show to even greater advantage with
the higher power of the Wasp, we now wangled a deal with Wright.
We actually persuaded good-natured Charlie Lawrance to turn
his pet airplane over to Chance Vought for the installation of a
Pratt and Whitney Wasp with which Lt. C. C. Champion, who had
now joined the Engine Section, was to take a shot at the world’s
record for altitude. With the completion of Chance Vought’s own
Corsair, we now had a brilliant two-seater that compared favorably
in performance with the hottest fighters, and thus gave us a stable
with which to make an assault on all the world’s records in their
classes. The admiral, a highly competitive spirit with a keen appreciation
of the value of world’s records and racing competition,
now made participation in these events a major Bureau project.</p>

<p>The names “Wasp” and “Corsair” had been selected by the Engine
Section, in response to requests from Pratt and Whitney and
Chance Vought. Little did we know at the time what distinction
they would one day attain. The Wright Apache focused attention
of other manufacturers on the characteristics of the Wasp; and
Boeing, after testing an engine in a converted FB-1 fighter, immediately
put a new one in the works to be called the “F2B.” Curtiss
made a conversion of one of its single-seater Hawks, replacing the
D-12 with a Wasp. The first Wasp engine to be flight tested was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
flown in a Curtiss Hawk and thus became a sort of monument to
the reluctance Curtiss had shown by their failure to develop their
own R-1454 engine. It also nearly became a monument to the failure
of the Pratt and Whitney Wasp.</p>

<p>For on the one-hour endurance test over Long Island, Temple
Joyce, then test pilot for Curtiss and one of the best-known figures
in aviation, grew tired of the monotony of cruising back and forth
and decided to vary the routine with some acrobatics. But when
he pulled back the stick and booted the rudder to do a nice snap
roll, something snapped in the Wasp and Temp had to make a
forced landing on the Curtiss field. The competitive Wasp in a
competitor’s airplane had gone sour on its test flight! Consternation
reigned in the Engine Section—matter of fact, it really poured.</p>

<p>Examination disclosed that the crankshaft counterweight had
sailed out through the crankcase. Now the cheek had been designed
with ample margins for the stresses of centrifugal force, and the
failure remained a mystery until I recalled a lesson learned as a
student in the Sperry Gyro Compass School several years earlier.
No one had anticipated the effect of gyroscopic forces like those
set up in a snap roll. Now George Mead took these in hand and
strengthened the shaft to withstand them. With this change, the
Pratt and Whitney Wasp came to stay.</p>

<p>One day George and I, feeling happy about this, decided to take
a walk through the Smithsonian Institution museum. And there we
saw something that cut us back to size. It was the Manly engine,
one designed by Charles M. Manly, the pilot and engineer of the
Langley airplane, the craft Professor Langley had tried to fly off
a catapult years earlier. And marvel of marvels, it was a five-cylinder,
single-row, air-cooled radial that antedated the original Wright
engine and all the other liquid-cooled in-line engines that had followed
it. Charles Manly, having no prior art to befuddle him, had
reasoned out the rational form for an aircraft engine and created one
forthwith. As we stood looking at the museum piece that included
the fundamentals we had used to obsolete years of automotive practice,
George grinned sheepishly and remarked, “It all goes to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
that every time you think you have discovered America, you find
that Columbus was here back in 1492.”</p>

<p>With the completion of many flight tests, the Wasp was now
ready for production. But Rentschler found himself in a quandary
as to what price he should ask for the engines in quantity. He had
no experienced costs, for no engine had yet been built in production.
We had asked for six engines on the first experimental order and
Kraus had paid Pratt and Whitney the $90,000 he had set aside for
them. It was estimated that this amount covered about half of the
experimental costs, and Kraus was willing to add the remainder to
the first production order so as to write off this expense. But no
one knew nor had any way of guessing what the unit price should
be for the order of some two hundred engines now required for
Vought Corsairs and Boeing and Curtiss fighters. And so the price
was fixed by that which Kraus had previously paid for a similar
number of Packard 1500’s—a liquid-cooled engine we had earlier
prescribed to replace the Curtiss D-12’s in the Boeing FB-5’s. For
while we had promoted the air-cooled vigorously we had likewise
developed the 500-hp Packard as a successor to the 400-hp Curtiss
D-12.</p>

<p>Rentschler was not too happy about having the price for his air-cooled
engines fixed by that of another contractor for liquid-cooled;
he insisted there was no relationship between the two. But in government
business, price may be fixed by anything else but merit. The
ever-present threat of a Congressional investigation made it impossible
to write into the Pratt and Whitney contract any figure
higher than the Packard price even though the circumstances might
be entirely different. This was but one of the things that made it
hard to interest private manufacturers in risking either their equities
or their engineering talent in a government speculation; none of
the business fundamentals with which they were accustomed to
measure their risks applied here.</p>

<p>However, as it turned out, an unexpected event exercised such
an influence that Pratt and Whitney not only did not lose money
on the first contract but even made an embarrassingly high profit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
It all started the morning William E. Boeing, of Seattle—not “Addison
Sims”—arrived in the Engine Section.</p>

<p>Bill Boeing, founder of the Boeing Airplane Company, and a successful
operator in lumber and real estate, had drawn his airplane-company
staff from versatile young graduates of the aeronautical-engineering
course of the University of Washington and had picked
some good ones. Foremost among these were Claire Egtvedt, his chief
engineer, and Phil Johnson, his factory manager. Bill, a pilot himself,
had opened an air line between Seattle and Victoria, using a couple of
Boeing-built flying boats under the management of Eddie Hubbard.
Eddie had persuaded Bill, against the advice of Phil Johnson, to
enter a bid for the new Chicago-San Francisco contract air-mail
route, and Bill had won the competition with a bid considered absurdly
low by his competitors.</p>

<p>As Bill took a chair by my desk that morning, he promptly
launched into the background of his low bid. It seems that Claire
Egtvedt, who had designed the single-seat fighter F2B around the
Wasp, had also made a study of that engine in a completely new
mail plane, to be called the “40-B.” By doing away with the heavy
cooling system of the Liberty in the new design, and availing himself
of the other features of the Wasp, he had turned out a mail
plane capable of carrying double the pay load on the same horsepower.
By converting several hundred pounds of dead load into as
many pounds of paying load, he had demonstrated the fact that no
operator could afford to use war-surplus airplanes—even as a gift—in
face of that kind of competition. Furthermore, Boeing could
build the new planes dirt cheap with the same overhead needed for
the military business. He thought the Wasp would revolutionize air
transport. His problem was how to get hold of about twenty-five new
Pratt and Whitneys right away with the entire production booked
for the Navy.</p>

<p>This was a matter on which the admiral had already set Bureau
policy. Having in mind the fact that if government and commercial
business could be lumped, the increased volume could bring reduced
costs for both, he had issued instructions to cooperate with commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
operators wherever practicable. All Bill needed was a letter
of introduction to F. B. Rentschler.</p>

<p>Out of this episode grew the Boeing Air Transport Company’s
profitable operation, the ultimate consolidation of Boeing and Pratt
and Whitney, to form the nucleus for the United Aircraft and
Transport Corporation, and such a profit for Pratt and Whitney on
the first order that Rentschler finally came to the Engine Section
for advice as to what should be done with the profit. Not the least
important factor in this achievement was the breathtaking daring
which Rentschler showed in tooling up his shop before the engine
had passed its tests and before he had received the contract. This
intelligent risk paid such dividends that Rentschler later agreed
with Kraus to return what might have been called “excess profits,”
and in so doing thus established a principle of voluntary profit control
that finally became the established policy of the company. The
original suggestion for this came from the Engine Section.</p>

<p>The development of the new engines and the creation of new aircraft
around them came just in time to ease a serious situation in
connection with the outfitting of the new carriers <em>Saratoga</em> and
<em>Lexington</em>. The ships were scheduled for completion in about two
years and their squadrons were even then being assembled at the
Fleet Air Stations at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and San Diego,
California. And while the Wasp put us on easier schedules for the
fighters, we were still up against it for the big torpedo-bomber scouts.
Our SC’s, designed originally around the Wright T-3, had proved
cumbersome and heavy and, while operable on twin floats, had
lacked the performance desired for carrier use. The large engine had
introduced a propeller problem, too—one that for a while had given
us a lot of concern.</p>

<p>One of the SC’s, equipped with a standard propeller made of
laminated woods glued together and finished to form, had let go on
take-off at Hampton Roads and the engine had nearly jumped out
of the plane. In response to an excited call from Norfolk, I had flown
down in company with Charles J. McCarthy, then our stress expert,
to see what could be done. Fortunately, about this time the Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Engineering Division at McCook Field had brought along an experimental
development, under the supervision of Frank Caldwell,
in which a new aluminum alloy called “duralumin” had been introduced
as a substitute for wood. So far it had not been fully proved
in service but we were in such a right spot that I now authorized the
procurement of the first production order for 100 of them.</p>

<p>Now to round out the carrier program we must needs do something
about those torpedo bombers. The engine situation began to
assume a certain stable pattern that could be used to foster development:
Wright had a nice bit of business and without serious competition
in the 200-hp air-cooled Whirlwind class; Pratt and Whitney
had a similar nest egg in their domination of the 400-hp Wasp category;
both companies had undertaken new developments in a larger
500-hp type. At Wright it was the Cyclone; at Pratt and Whitney,
the Hornet. But neither of these engines looked big enough for the
torpedo-bomber class and every engineer in the industry had solemnly
assured me in writing that to build a 600-hp air-cooled radial
was completely impossible. In light of this dictum we had installed
a Packard 2500, 800-hp liquid-cooled engine in one of the SC’s
which we had called the “SC-6” but which the mechanics had
promptly dubbed the “<em>Sea Cow</em>.” Now the time had arrived to give
the old girl an endurance test.</p>

<p>The personnel of the Engine Section had undergone some change
since my taking over. After Ricco Botta had gone to sea I brought
in Lt. L. D. Webb, a naval aviator and experienced engineer. Lee
had started his naval career as an enlisted man and had served as
an electrician in a submarine. In World War I he had qualified as a
pilot and been commissioned in the Reserve. Later he had taken
the examinations and transferred to the regular service. He was a
burly fellow with a broad back, the kind you like to ride behind
in an airplane. With Lee in the cockpit, me in the rear seat, and Capt.
Lionel M. Woolson, the Packard experimental engineer, lying on a
mattress back in the tail, the <em>Sea Caw</em> started her take-off at dawn
from the bosom of the Potomac River abreast of the spot where the
Presidential Yacht <em>Mayflower</em> lay. We were so heavily laden with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
fuel that we missed the first run after roaring past the <em>Mayflower</em>
wide open with our eight hundred horses straining. On the second
run past, I noticed a figure in a nightgown waving encouragement
to us, but a second look revealed it as President Coolidge himself and
his clenched fist waved no encouragement.</p>

<p>And as hour after hour we droned up and down Chesapeake Bay,
trying to burn out the fuel to determine our real endurance, I began
thinking of a scheme that might solve our problem. Certainly
the big liquid-cooled Packard didn’t make sense; but a 600-hp air-cooled
might do the job. Our <em>Sea Cow</em> grossed some 12,000 pounds
of dead weight with her full load of fuel and was correspondingly
big and unwieldy. If someone could build a 600-hp radial he would
automatically save nearly a ton right off the bat; and if some smart
designer could find a way to build a lighter airplane structure, we
might get the whole thing down to something of the order of 7,500
pounds. This would give us a smaller, handier airplane that would
still carry the bomb, torpedo, and fuel load we wanted, and thus
complete the outfit for our new carriers with an all-air-cooled complement.
The problem was how to get the job done—and Old Man
Competition was the obvious answer.</p>

<p>The chance of a lifetime came one day with a visit from the dean
of our aircraft manufacturers, Glenn L. Martin. Glenn’s black mood
quite overshadowed his natty dress. He was about to finish his contract
for torpedoplanes and had no new business in sight. First thing
BUAERO knew he’d have to fire his whole organization and, once
they got scattered, their know-how and teamwork would be lost
forever. It was up to the Bureau to do something to save Glenn
Martin.</p>

<p>“Have you tried creating a new model, Glenn?” I asked innocently
enough. Glenn protested that his SC was the last word and
that nothing much better could be produced.</p>

<p>“I’ve had an idea checked out by the drafting room,” I said, “and
they agree that if some smart airplane manufacturer were to design
a new torpedo carrier around, say a new six hundred-horsepower
air-cooled engine, he could get it down to about seventy-five hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
pounds gross, provided he could develop some new structural
features along the lines that Charles Ward Hall has proposed.”</p>

<p>Glenn was skeptical; and besides, he and the others had little confidence
in those tricky aluminum structures that Charles Ward Hall
proposed; they held out for welded steel. And besides, where could
you get a 600-hp air-cooled radial?</p>

<p>“Both the Cyclone and Hornet do five hundred twenty-five horsepower
now,” I said, “and if a smart airplane designer made a deal
with one or the other for a 600-hp type, say a year from now, the
direct competition in that class might persuade one or both of them
to push the development for you in time to give you the power
you need, and by that time you can have your revolutionary model.”</p>

<p>Glenn’s puckered brow suggested thought. “Do you think the
Bureau would finance such a development,” he asked, “with an experimental
contract?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I agreed, “up at the Naval Aircraft Factory at Philadelphia.”
Glenn was shocked by the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Have you mentioned this to anyone else?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Everyone who would listen,” I replied. “And Frank Russell, of
Curtiss, is coming in this afternoon. I thought that since you had
taken his SC design away from him by underbidding him on the
production order, he might find a certain satisfaction in doing likewise
by you.”</p>

<p>By the time I had finished the sentence, Glenn had disappeared
through the door.</p>

<p>With the carrier program pretty well rounded up, I began to
think of going back to sea duty and general service. If I wasted
much more time in the side shows, some future Selection Board
would gladly skip me over. No use to ask the admiral’s permission;
he’d say the job was but half done and he couldn’t spare me. A personal
visit to the Bureau of Navigation and a request to command
another destroyer would do the trick.</p>

<p>But when, shortly afterward, Admiral Moffett called me into his
office, I found the atmosphere distinctly chilly. On his desk lay the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
notice from BUNAV advising him of the intention to detach me
and requesting that he nominate a suitable relief.</p>

<p>“What will it take to keep you here?” the admiral asked.</p>

<p>“A nonflying officer has no place in this game,” I replied, “and
I’m supposed to be too old to learn to fly.”</p>

<p>“The pilot course,” replied the admiral, “takes nine months and
I can’t spare you that long.” I had not intended to ask for flight
training but the admiral assumed that I was putting pressure on him.</p>

<p>“I could send you to Pensacola for two months for training as
Naval Observer,” he went on, “and that might take the curse off
shore duty by making you a part of the aeronautic organization.”</p>

<p>My next remark surprised me; certainly it came from my mouth
rather than my head, though my heart may have been in it. “If I
could wangle a way to complete the pilot’s course in two months,”
I inquired, “would that be acceptable to you?”</p>

<p>The admiral grinned as he held out his hand. “When you arrive
at Pensacola,” he advised, “drop in on Brooks Upham, the Commandant.
He’s a personal friend of mine and might be able to do
something for you.”</p>

<p>Thus quite without prior intent on my part I had talked my way
even deeper into aviation. But at home that evening I did not reveal
the whole scheme to my wife. Having received word of her mother’s
serious illness she had left the day before for an indefinite visit at her
home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_NINE">CHAPTER NINE<br>
The Gospel According to Aunt Lucy</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Rear Adm. F. Brooks Upham, Commandant of the Naval Air
Station, Pensacola, reached across his flat-topped desk for my formal
orders. Behind him through the window, the sun glinted on the leaves
of ancient live oaks, and filtered through shreds of gently swaying
Spanish moss. The rattle of aircraft engines disturbed the still morning,
a signal that flying was being resumed after the September hurricane
that had seriously damaged this ancient Civil War navy yard.
The admiral welcomed me with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a note about you from Moffett,” he volunteered. “So,”
he added, “it’s the old story of old dogs and new tricks. Having now
reached the ripe old age of thirty-nine,” he went on, “you’re dead
but won’t lie down. If you ask me, it’s a lot of bunk.”</p>

<p>“The Regulations,” I reminded him, “set twenty-eight as the
maximum age limit for flight training.” The admiral reached for the
top drawer of his antique desk. A warm breeze floated in from across
the Gulf of Mexico. Beyond the signal tower, across the blue harbor,
the white sands of Santa Rosa Island gleamed in the sunlight. Still
farther out glittered the quiet waters of the Gulf.</p>

<p>The commandant handed me a sheet of paper. I recognized it at
once as a few lines of doggerel I had written one wintry December
night while the old seaplane tender and kite-balloon ship <em>Wright</em>
had lain in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We had been working all day
on a miserably cold job of ballasting the <em>Old Hooker</em> and had turned
the duty over to the aviators as a part of their instruction. Then
suddenly someone of them had discovered that none of them had
qualified as yet for their 50 per cent increase for “flight pay” and
that unless they corrected this fault immediately they would lose
the allowance. They had all laid down their tools, both the lighter-than-air
and the heavier-than-air pilots, and had rushed over to the
Naval Air Station at Lakehurst to ride up and down ten times in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
kite-balloon attached to a winch in a warm hangar, leaving the ballasting
to the mercies of the ship’s company, the so-called “thicker-than-mud.”
Now I read the verses.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The lighter-than-air are jolly boys,</div>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>
<p>I glanced up to find a smile on the commandant’s lips.</p>

<p>“I found it in the desk here,” he said, “after I had taken over from
Christy.”</p>

<p>We had visited the <em>Wright</em> in the summer of 1922 after ferrying
some F-5-L’s down from Philadelphia and someone must have lifted
the masterpiece from the bulletin board.</p>

<p>“I had hardly expected to find the author of that among the
candidates for flight training,” Brooks Upham went on, “but since
you are here I’ll do my best for you. My aide, young Jimmy Lowry,
will take you out for a flight check and if he rates you ‘promising
material,’ I’ll see that planes are put at your disposal at any time you
may want them. No need for you to fool around with the regular
schedule for ground school; you know all that. It’s simply a question
of nervous and physical endurance whether you can complete the
entire course in the two months.” He reached for a push button.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he added, “my lady asked me to invite you to dine
with us this evening—seven o’clock—service uniform.”</p>

<p>Within a half hour, Jimmy Lowry and I were down at Squadron
Six Beach warming up an N-9 seaplane. The Consolidated NY’s had
gone into service for land-plane training but the N-9’s still survived
for work on floats. Jimmy, after a few words of instruction, motioned
me into the rear seat and took his instructor’s position in
front. Then signaling to the “boots” to cast us off, he opened the
throttle and taxied out into the stream where he cut the gun and let
the little plane idle up into the wind.</p>

<p>He gave her the gun and as the engine took hold we skittered
smoothly over the surface and into the air to sail out over the landlocked
bay. Below us, the old town of Pensacola nestled among live
oaks and Spanish moss now devastated by the hurricane. While I
had taken the controls now and then, flying as a passenger, I had
never presumed to land or take off and had had no other instruction
than the few orders Jimmy Lowry had given me back there at the
Beach. Now he shook the controls as a signal for me to take over
and, as I did so, held both hands aloft to signal that I had charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Jimmy Lowry now put me through all the “checks” in accordance
with what I learned later was a well-established routine. He sent me
flying over the land at an altitude of about fifty feet and, after
we had proceeded too far to permit turning back for a water landing
in case of engine failure, he cut the gun and watched my reaction.
The only thing I could see to do was to land straight ahead into
the palmetto swamp, and this, I learned later, was considered to be
good “reaction in emergency.” Jimmy opened the throttle again
before we tangled with the palm fronds, and then waved me back
to Squadron Six Beach. He said nothing as we walked up the ramp
and, at the entrance to Bachelor Officer Quarters, simply saluted
and walked off toward the commandant’s office. Still in the dark as
to my future, I hunted up my room in “BOQ” and found my baggage
already in it. A colored maid was making up the bed.</p>

<p>She had a wrinkled, light-chocolate old face, framed by kinky
white hair held in a tight knot at the back of her neck. Though she
was said to have been born into slavery, her erect, almost haughty
carriage seemed to deny the story. She turned to bow to me in a
curtsy that was dignified and respectful.</p>

<p>“Mawnin’, sah!” she said. Her soft voice had the resonance of a
singer of Negro spirituals. “Ah’s Aunt Lucy,” she added. “I takes
keer o’ dis room for de gempmens what has it. Ah unpacks yo satchel,
too, if you likes.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I’ll stay, Aunt Lucy,” I replied. “We won’t unpack
until I hear from Lieutenant Lowry.” Aunt Lucy bowed her
head as she moved off to dust the window sills. She had that air of
quiet dignity, that sense of being wholly at peace with the world,
that had characterized the old-time darkies I had known as a midshipman
back at little Annapolis. A leader among her people, a
deaconess in the church, no doubt, Aunt Lucy seemed a woman
distinguished by deep religious faith. I had unbelted my sword after
leaving the commandant’s office and, after my check flight, had
carried it to BOQ in my hand. Now as I laid it on the table Aunt
Lucy glanced at it and began humming an old spiritual:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’se goin’ to lay down my sword and shield.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Down by de riverside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Down by de riverside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Down by de riverside.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’se goin’ to lay down my sword and shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Down by de riverside</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I ain’t goin’ to study war no mo’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As she drifted out of the door the telephone rang. It was the
commandant. As I reached for the receiver, I could feel a flush
creeping up the back of my neck and knew for the first time
just how much I wanted a favorable report. Well, I’d soon know,
now.</p>

<p>“Lowry has passed your check,” Brooks Upham was saying. “He
considers you ‘good pilot material.’ See you for dinner!” I hung up
and called down the corridor to old Aunt Lucy.</p>

<p>“I guess you can unpack the satchel,” I said.</p>

<p>The Uphams were distinctly Old Navy, part of a small coterie of
distinguished senior officers and their wives who had served the
Navy through the lean years, on duty that had either taken them
to distant foreign stations together or forced long separations. They
were men and women who had stood for all that was best in loyalty
to their country, their service, and to one another, and who supported
the fine traditions of the earlier days. Poor in worldly goods, yet
they were rich in experience, having traveled widely and lived close
to the people of foreign lands. Money had meant little to them; they
had found ample compensation in their knowledge of a public
service faithfully performed. Evenings at the commandant’s quarters
were to prove important events in my training as a naval aviator;
and old Aunt Lucy was to leave her mark, too.</p>

<p>For flying was still a hazardous business back in the middle twenties,
and tragedy cast its shadow all too often over the little station
at Pensacola. Perhaps it was this that focused people’s thoughts on
things far removed from “pounds per horsepower.” After dinner that
evening, the commandant and his lady sat with me around the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
that provided the only warmth against the evening chill, and discussed
books they had just finished reading.</p>

<p>The commandant had been deep in a treatise on nuclear theory
as discussed in a book called <cite>The New Knowledge</cite>. It had been
written in a popular and entertaining vein by a scientific author whose
name I don’t now recall and, besides setting forth clearly the new idea
as to the structure of the atom and a theory of electronics, it had
developed an absorbing spiritual theme. The author, recognizing the
resemblance between the laws controlling the actions of electrons
within the atom and those that controlled the astronomy of the
universe, had emphasized his own conviction that no conflict existed
between religion and science. On the contrary, the more a scientific
mind studied the revelations concerning the physical world, the
stronger became his convictions as to the existence of an infinite God.</p>

<p>The commandant’s lady fingered a book she had just finished but
seemed to hesitate about opening a discussion of it.</p>

<p>“If you are like the rest of the students,” she smiled, “you’ll have
your nose buried so deeply in that precious <cite>Flight Manual</cite>, that
you’ll have no time for anything else.”</p>

<p>The commandant was rather proud of that <cite>Flight Manual</cite>. It
was the book of instruction for the flight-training course that had
been evolved out of long experience with many students. It had
been compiled by one of his instructors, Lt. Barrett Studley, who was
also writing a book on the subject. Every detail was so well covered
in it that it had become a veritable “student’s bible.” No matter
how often he read it and reread it or practiced the maneuvers
described in it, every new reading revealed something there he
had not previously absorbed. Even the instructors boned the manual—and
found new inspiration in doing so.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Upham talked, the commandant stirred the fire until it
burned brightly, shining on his wife’s serene features.</p>

<p>“My book,” she said, “bears on the same theme as the one developed
by <cite>The New Knowledge</cite> but approaches it from a wholly
different point of view.”</p>

<p>She went on to point out that its author, whose name I have forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
along with the title of the book, had been a successful minister—at
least one might judge him so by usual standards. He had
managed a large New York congregation, kept the church in repair,
and collected substantial sums of money for worthy causes.
But after his retirement he had reached the conclusion that his
ministry had been a complete failure. Lacking faith in religion, because
he had not been able to reconcile the Christian Gospel with
his reasoned analysis of it, he had failed in his spiritual leadership.</p>

<p>Deep concern over this had caused him to restudy the Gospels
and especially the history of their composition; and he had concluded
that in the interim between the death of the Apostles and the compilation
of the Gospels, numerous additions might have been made
and certain beliefs carried over from earlier faiths might have been
interlarded into the basic concept of the Christian idea. He had
therefore set about to delete from the Gospels, as recorded, all the
inconsistencies with the Gospel as he thought it must have been
preached, and had emerged with a kernel so dazzling and completely
credible to the rational mind that he had become convinced that it
must have been divinely inspired.</p>

<p>For no one man nor group of men could possibly have conceived
a faith so wholly consistent and so inspiring as had Jesus Christ himself.
The very idea of individual dignity had brought men conviction
that they were not meant to be slaves but responsible children of
God. With that conviction, human liberty was born. And human
liberty was not just a pleasant material situation but the world’s
most vital, dynamic, and constructive spiritual force. To cast off the
rule of tyrants men must only be governed by God.</p>

<p>As the commandant’s lady finished her review, she handed her
book over to me.</p>

<p>“Since we’ve been on duty down here,” she said simply, “we’ve
come to sense the semireligious fervor with which the lads approach
their flying. The hazards seem but to lift up their spirits, for while
physically the airplane is mechanical, yet the art of flying has the
flavor of high destiny.” She paused and glanced quickly at her husband
as if for support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“We haven’t succeeded in crystallizing the idea,” said the admiral,
“but even as professional military people we keep groping for the
philosophical import of this new device. The thing is potentially
so destructive that unless we find some way, through the spirit, to
adapt it to constructive uses, it will surely destroy us.”</p>

<p>For a while we three sat silent before the fire. Brooks Upham had
expressed the unease that lies heavy on the hearts of military men;
they dislike the business of destruction.</p>

<p>When, next morning, I arrived at Squadron Six Beach, my instructor
was waiting for me with orders to disregard the routine and
feed the subject to me just as fast as I could take it. I had, however,
been assigned to Class Twenty-six—youngsters, for the most part,
two to three years out of Annapolis. Included in the class, however,
were a handful of seniors like “Baldy” Pownall, “Woody” Thomas,
Harry Bogusch, and Freddie Kauffman. For Admiral Moffett, having
felt the need of a little seasoning in the aeronautic organization, had
accepted applications from a selected group of more experienced
line officers. Among them were former submarine officers who, thinking
that duty a little too hazardous to health, had transferred to the
comparative safety of flying.</p>

<p>And thus began a most delightful experience. For the first time
in many moons, my responsibilities were reduced to the lowest possible
terms. All I now had to do was to maneuver a nice little airplane,
one that seemed to sense my intentions and even anticipate
them, and to execute turns, glides, and landings smoothly and competently
and—to my surprise—without dunking me in the drink.
The pullings and haulings of BUAERO, the plot and counterplot
of politics, now faded into the limbo. And in their places came the
thrill of facing hazards—and overcoming them. Raised as I had been
in an era when men had not asked extra compensation for extra
hazard in the line of duty, I held a secret hunch that a man should
be glad to pay something extra for the privilege of enjoying such a
happy and uncomplicated routine. Naturally I did not voice this
mutiny to my instructors.</p>

<p>With my solo safely behind me, I moved ahead with renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
confidence and from that day forward averaged nearly five hours
solo almost every working day, passing one check after the other
and moving steadily along on schedule. Meanwhile an unexpected
influence had entered into my training, insinuating itself in a delicate
sort of way; it was old Aunt Lucy.</p>

<p>It had started one sunny morning when, standing in front of the
mirror to tie my black four-in-hand tie, I had, in sheer exuberance,
burst out singing “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.” Aunt Lucy, who
seemed to be forever dusting the furniture when I was in the room,
and who was always fingering my dress sword, as if fascinated by
it, now interrupted my music.</p>

<p>“Oh, no sah!” she protested. “Not dataway! Not dataway!”</p>

<p>And then with one foot tapping and her gay turbaned old head
bobbing to the rhythm, Aunt Lucy proceeded to swing that old
chariot so low it got dizzy. The song ended, she cackled and waddled
off down the corridor, but in response to my vociferous applause
she was soon back again, dustcloth in hand, flicking specks off the battered
furniture of the bare room.</p>

<p>From that moment, Lucy took my Bible instruction in hand and
carried it out through a series of Negro spirituals, with a technique
that would have impressed Lt. Barrett Studley, the author of the
<cite>Flight Manual</cite>. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace
vied with Joshua, as he fit de Battle uv Jericho, to bring me up
to date on “de ole time religion.” Then one Sunday morning old
Aunt Lucy invited me to witness a baptizin’ in a nearby bayou where
a white-robed, black-faced preacherman, knee deep on a convenient
sand bar, ducked his shouting converts. Next morning I noticed her
flitting around my sword, where it stood in the corner, and heard
her humming the second verse of the first song she had sung to me.</p>

<p>Of an original class of some thirty students, only about twenty
survived the rigorous course. The others either lacked the natural
coordination essential to instinctive flying or failed on that other
important requirement “correct reaction in emergency.” The first
could be acquired by early athletic instruction, but the second
seemed to be innate in some, wholly lacking in others. It was the unpleasant
duty of the check instructor to detect the lack of that attribute
before it could produce fatal results. But to men who had
natural aptitude in the basic requirements, flying had an extraordinary
appeal. There was all the intense satisfaction to be experienced
through skill in any art, such as the smooth stroking of a tennis ball,
the rhythmic swing of a golf club, or the exquisitely precise casting
of a feathered salmon fly—all these were experienced by the student
pilot, but with the added thrill that a mistake invited disaster.</p>

<p>During the month of November I graduated from the seaplane
beach and moved over into landplanes. My classmates, following the
more leisurely normal course, remained behind. In landplanes, we
used the new Consolidate NY’s and, while they had few of the pleasant
flying qualities of the little N-9’s, they didn’t kill students in
crack-ups.</p>

<p>Finally came November 30, 1926, and with it my final check.
“Dixie” Ketcham, my check instructor, put me through the paces
and then waved me back toward Old Corry Field. I was sitting there
calmly enjoying the scenery below, but with one eye, as always, roving
about in search of a place to land in case of engine failure, when
the engine stopped. Below me lay a tiny cow pasture, the spot in
which, no doubt, I was supposed to land. But it was so tiny I felt
certain that Dixie would open the throttle again after I had demonstrated
the required approach technique. And so I settled down to
the “normal approach”: a left turn to get downwind, a glide over
the tops of the jack pine, a slip to lose altitude, a sunfish to kill extra
speed, stick-back to break the glide—but the throttle didn’t open
and we went on in a nice landing.</p>

<p>As we reached the end of the run, just short of the edge of the
field—we had no brakes then, nor did we use flaps—Dixie waved
a hand as the signal to go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“If you can get into a pasture like that,” he said, “you can get in
anywhere!”</p>

<p>Back at my quarters in BOQ I walked on air. Aunt Lucy with her
everlasting dustcloth fiddled around the gilt sword knot of the class
of 1871 prize sword. And as she dusted it, she hummed the final
verse of the spiritual she had sung so often for me.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tossing my helmet and goggles onto the bed and reaching for
my suitcase, I began packing my duffel for the return trip to Washington.
Aunt Lucy was folding my best blue blouse with its shiny
three stripes and, best of all, my new gold wings pinned on its breast.
Under her breath she kept humming.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a goin’ to study wah no mo!” I stopped to look at her.</p>

<p>“Aunt Lucy,” I demanded, “is it by accident or design that you
keep singing that song at me?” Aunt Lucy chuckled.</p>

<p>“Well, sah,” she replied in her deep contralto, “ah thought maybe
now you done learned to fly like de angels, you might like to think a
little about peace.”</p>

<p>“Why,” I retorted, “that’s just what a navy is for—to keep
peace.”</p>

<p>“Yassah, yassah,” Aunt Lucy persisted, fingering the gold pin
on my best blouse, “but it jes’ seem to Aunt Lucy dat, now de Lord
done gib yo’ wings, maybe yo’ might find better use for dem dan
jes fightin’.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The telephone jingled. Western Union had a wire for me. My
wife was thrilled by the news of my gold wings; she had left for
Washington to reopen the apartment.</p>

The Take-off</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Back in Washington, the admiral welcomed me with a grin and
promptly assigned me a new job as Chief of the Airplane Design
Section. This was a naval constructor’s stronghold, and even though
we line officers had pretty well dominated design down in the Engine
Section, I could have been made to feel like a blacksmith in a glassworks,
had it not been for my new wings and my postgraduate engineering
course under Dr. Lucke. But by now the vision he had foreseen
had begun to come to pass: the “professors” and the “practical
men” had got together in the person of the engineer, and the world
was already on fire with new developments.</p>

<p>Among other things the great engineering societies, like the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Institute of Electrical
Engineers, the Society of Civil Engineers, and others, had
joined hands to build a new Engineering Societies’ Building on 39th
Street in New York City, where they had their several offices and
conducted their technical sessions. One of these societies extended an
invitation to Admiral Moffett to address a joint session on naval
aviation and the admiral passed the job of writing the screed on to
me. But when I handed the finished product over to him, he glanced
at the title “Power Plants for Aircraft,” and grinned.</p>

<p>“You read it,” he directed.</p>

<p>I read it at a session at Pennsylvania State College and afterward,
to my surprise, learned that it had won some kind of award. To receive
this prize, I attended a session in the New York auditorium of
the society’s building and in the course of a little talk, told the story
of how George Mead and I, after the “invention” of the air-cooled
engine, had discovered its prototype in the Smithsonian Institution
in the power plant of the early Langley airplane, the Manly engine.
There was a disturbance in the back of the auditorium and a
member stood up to remark that Mr. Charles M. Manly was right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
there in the audience. Amid the shouts that followed, Mr. Manly was
belatedly revealed as a great pioneer.</p>

<p>In addition to the journals and technical papers of the booming
American societies, we received the best articles from foreign countries.
Among these, the Royal Aeronautical Society of London
furnished almost world leadership, while the English magazine,
<cite>The Airplane</cite>, edited by an outspoken character, C. G. Grey, published
stimulating news and comment. Articles in German and
French were translated and distributed through BUAERO in such
profusion that it required a lot of homework just to keep up with
the ever-changing nomenclature of a rapidly growing art. The
most scientific writings came to us from the British National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, but gradually our own committee
with the same name began to forge to the front with selected
articles and digests of the best laboratory reports from all over the
world.</p>

<p>There was some discussion as to the wisdom of releasing the latest
in research or development in this country in exchange for similar
data from abroad, but the admiral settled it characteristically. If
you couldn’t keep ahead of the other fellow by resort to your own
initiative and enterprise in a free market, he felt, then you certainly
couldn’t beat him on a closed circuit. An alert mind could often find
something in the other fellow’s research which the other fellow
might have missed; and if the other fellow beat you to the punch
in your own field, you deserved to lose out. The admiral’s highly
competitive spirit kept the whole Bureau on its toes and a word of
commendation from him fired his supporters to play better ball
than they really knew how.</p>

<p>This general type of leadership seemed to permeate the Washington
atmosphere of the middle ’twenties. The team of Harding and
Coolidge had been elected to office on the slogan of a “Return to
Normalcy.” The American people had tasted the European way in
World War I and had found it bitter indeed. Then, after President
Harding had died, Mr. Coolidge had taken office and given us an
administration founded on New England character and integrity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
This had been particularly apparent in the monetary field. We in
BUAERO had to supply Admiral Moffett with sound bases for our
requests for appropriations, but when we did, the Old Man would
come through; he had a rare knack for getting money, especially
after he had established the principle of the five-year plan. But we
were expected to make our appropriations pay dividends; they
weren’t handouts for “social” purposes.</p>

<p>We didn’t pretend to know anything about the obscure theories
of economics, but anyone could understand the soundness of Mr.
Andrew Mellon’s tax policies. The war had left us with the heaviest
debt in the history of the country, and with income taxes at high
rates. Mr. Mellon seemed determined to reduce the debt, and to
this end he resorted to reduced taxation. Meanwhile Mr. Coolidge
sat on the lid in so far as expenses were concerned. In BUAERO we
got no sudden slashing, but a quiet mandate that when a vacancy
occurred, it would not be filled; the work would either be divided
among others or, if unnecessary, be allowed to lapse. And between
the two processes, prosperity returned. Reduced taxes made funds
available for new enterprises; new enterprises paid new taxes which
further reduced the debt. Mr. Mellon now began anticipating this
result by further tax reductions, which accelerated the creation of
new enterprises and new jobs. And so a boom was born and men
talked of the “new economic era.”</p>

<p>With the Morrow Board policy and the Moffett five-year building
program as its foundation, and the favorable climate of the new
economic era as its medium, American aviation seemed to turn
around almost overnight. The surviving domestic companies, impelled
by the incentive of constructive competition, began forging
ahead with their integrated programs of research, development,
and production. Foreign designers who had languished in the bad
atmosphere of war-torn Europe now began peddling their know-how
in the promised land. Mr. Anthony Fokker, the rough-and-ready
Dutch designer of the famous German Fokkers of World War
I, appeared with a new transport designed around the Liberty engine.
It had a welded-steel tubular fuselage and a thick monoplane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
wing made of plywood. With the Liberty it could be nothing but a
“kluck” but with three Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radials, it
was a hot number. When Dick Byrd planned to fly over the North
Pole I wangled one of them for him which he used with conspicuous
success. The smaller Fokker Universal made history in the Canadian
bush.</p>

<p>Igor Sikorsky, who, as a pioneer Russian pilot and constructor, had
built the first four-engined bomber but had left revolution-torn
Russia for free America, now designed a remarkably efficient big
bomber or transport and began developing his twin-engined amphibian.
Giuseppe Ballanca, after setting up shop in Wilmington,
Delaware, produced a single-engined cargo carrier, designed around
a single Wright Whirlwind engine with which Lt. C. C. Champion
of BUAERO’s Engine Section, now headed by Henry Mullinix,
won all the prizes for speed and efficiency at the Philadelphia national
air races.</p>

<p>And a new crop of American designers sprang up almost overnight.
Tom Hamilton, of Milwaukee, built a single-motored, high-wing
metal monoplane around the Pratt and Whitney Hornet engine
and put it into service on many freight routes. Mr. Henry Ford,
inspired by zeal to do something concrete for aviation, supported his
chief engineer, William Mayo, in the development of the Ford
Trimotor—a high-wing, metal monoplane built around three Wright
Whirlwinds—and its sale to budding air transport lines at a price
which would permit profitable operations. In this Mr. Ford was not
prompted by the modern incentive of “tax loss”—that idea had not
been born in an era of American initiative and enterprise.</p>

<p>Numerous other enterprisers like Stearman, of Wichita, Kansas,
and Stinson, of Detroit, Michigan, began creating private aircraft
to exploit the coming boom in personal flying. Many, drawing the
analogy with the automobile, were convinced that this boom had
already arrived, and began building airports and flying services all
over the country. Much of this building was based on shoestring
finance, but some of it was sound. And all of it might have made
steady progress except for one thing: speculation permeated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
sound core of aviation just as it ate at the vitals of all other industry.</p>

<p>Even naval officers, who up until then had seemed to pride themselves
on a certain aloofness to the marts of trade, now began dabbling
in “the market.” Profits here were sure and swift—provided
always you were on the inside. One of our friends had an inside tip
on a new graveyard to be constructed within the city limits of Los
Angeles, with the advice and consent of the City Council, where
profits were quick and sure. The harvest for this enterprise was
guaranteed to be as sure as—say, death and taxes. This friend looked
down his nose at another man whose mouselike wife had been inveigled
by a door-to-door salesman into buying a lot in Long Beach,
California. The extra burden of paying for this “investment” was
about to break the couple down when someone poked a hole in a
nearby piece of ground and the oil field on Signal Hill was born.
Now the young wife followed the young husband’s battleship
around in her private yacht. But none of this seemed to discourage
creative enterprise, like the rising aircraft manufacturing and air-transport
industries.</p>

<p>Among the newcomers in the manufacturing field, Donald Douglas
and “Dutch” Kindleberger began to stand out. Prior to their advent,
most of the newcomers had been alumni of the great Curtiss Aeroplane
Company, of Garden City, Long Island. But Glenn L. Martin,
an early bird who had pioneered American twin-engined bombers
with his famous Martin bomber, had collected a stable of promising
colts; Don Douglas, Dutch Kindleberger, and Larry Bell had worked
for him until some temperamental disagreement sent all three on independent
projects. After that, each concentrated his efforts to
outdoing the others, and especially the old master, Glenn Martin.
We in BUAERO, sitting as we did at the crossroads, could always
get the dirt and low-down from the visiting firemen and, after
sifting it and appraising it, use our own judgment in how to make
it pay dividends in new development. Intercompany competition
mixed up with interservice competition and whirled about in the
old slipstream might look disorderly and inefficient, but it was motivated
by highly creative impulses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Admiral Moffett kept his own Bureau on its toes by involving us
in all sorts of racing or other projects. Back in Bruce Leighton’s time,
BUAERO had given Don Douglas the job of building an experimental
single-engined Liberty torpedo-bomber plane—one with
extra large tanks for long-range flying. But after Don had produced
a masterpiece, the Army Air Service seized upon the type while the
Navy dawdled, and the Army had completed the first ’round-the-world
flight. This job, a masterpiece of planning and operations,
proved such a pronounced success that it gave great impetus to
other projects. It also gave the Navy such pain that Admiral Moffett
never got over it.</p>

<p>The classic international seaplane race had long been the Schneider
Trophy and the admiral had set his heart on winning it. The expenditure
of time, money, and effort could be justified then because
it always stimulated technical progress. And so BUAERO created
a new class of racers and brought the trophy to America; the admiral,
master that he was of the art of publicity, played up the results to
the fullest. The Navy had also entered the classic land-plane races
using special racers in the “free-for-all pursuit.” Then, since turn
about had always been fair play, the Army entered Jimmy Doolittle
in the Schneider Cup seaplane races and won them hands down. This
was the same Jimmy Doolittle who would one day take off in an
Army bomber from the Navy carrier <em>Hornet</em> in our first air raid on
Tokyo. Meanwhile, the middle ’twenties were a free-swinging era
of intense competition that pushed American aeronautics to the
forefront of world progress. The bursting bubble of stock-market
speculation in 1929 squeezed out the small fry, but the big boys went
on for a while longer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I found my new flying ability most useful in my billet
as Chief of Design. On a training-plane competition between Boeing
and Huff-Daland, I was able to check the trial-board report myself
and, being fresh out of Pensacola, to do so with a fair knowledge of
the latest edition of the <cite>Flight Manual</cite>. The Boeing developed a characteristic
which, until then, was new to us. Pete Mitscher, the same
Pete who would one day command Task Force 58 in the Pacific and
earn from his mates the reputation for being the ablest air commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
of them all, got into a flat spin at 6,000 feet over Washington and
windmilled to a crash on the end of Haines Point, where he stepped
out of the damaged plane quite unharmed. Had he known about flat
spins back in the days of the “Affair Fleet,” things would have been
more difficult.</p>

<p>Then one of these tests of mine came near to washing me out of
aviation’s slipstream forever and leaving me as a part of the permanent
“slip.”</p>

<p>There had been some discussion in BUAERO of a suggestion to
equip Pensacola with some advanced combat trainers by taking the
Pratt and Whitney Wasp out of the Curtiss Hawk and substituting
in it the lower-power Wright Whirlwind. I had argued against this
and suggested obtaining the same result by flying the standard Hawks
with partly open throttles. And in order to prove the efficacy of this,
I went over to the Naval Air Station, Anacostia, where we did our
flight testing, to put on a demonstration. When I waddled out in
my flying suit and parachute, I found the plane turning up on the
line, but the mechanic was dissatisfied with the way the engine was
running. It was one hundred revs short of the full-throttle crank
speed. Since this might be due to a weak spark plug or some other
minor fault and since I intended to fly at half throttle anyway, I got
in, taxied out onto the field, and took off.</p>

<p>The Anacostia Naval Air Station occupied about half of a flat
strip of land and had its hangars and shops along the river front. The
Army Bolling Field occupied the other part of the reservation with
its old wartime buildings lying under the hill on which stands St.
Elizabeth’s Hospital. If the presence of an institution for the insane,
overlooking the rival Army and Navy fields on the same plot, had
any significance, I was not concerned with it that day. What I
had to look out for, however, was the extensive regrading going on,
which limited the operating area to a narrow tract.</p>

<p>My take-off was diagonally across the field toward the bluff, and
the little Hawk, to my delight, fairly leaped into the air at half
throttle, and climbed over the trees. Turning to the left, looking
down on the hospital, I noticed the circle that marked the landing
area, and promptly cut the switch to make a dead-stick precision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
landing on it. When this turned out well, I started the engine and
repeated the maneuver. On the third take-off, noticing a certain
roughness in the engine, I opened the throttle wide, thinking to
clear a possible fouled plug. But even as I did so, I felt something let
go and noticed the ears of the valve rocker box covers drop below
the rim of the engine cowl.</p>

<p>There was a sudden “whoosh” and the cockpit filled with flames.
Instinctively I cut back the throttle, slapped off the switch, and pulled
the fire-extinguisher knob. As I reached behind me alongside the
seat for the fuel cutoff valve, I glanced into the cockpit where the
flames were licking my stick hand, and curling up around my ankles
beneath my slacks. When I looked out again, we were nearing the
end of the field. At such a low altitude I could not jump and now, to
get the flames out of my face, I kicked into a steep slip to the left
which headed us out over the Potomac River. A water landing to a
sailor has more appeal than a crack-up in a thicket, and I held the
heading until it was certain I could not stretch the river. Then, close
to the ground, I booted the rudder to fishtail her the other way and
followed this with four hard kicks alternating left and right until
she had lost speed. Now as the burning Hawk touched down hard,
I had an overwhelming sense of panic; the next thing I knew I was
on the ground on my hands and knees and the plane was crackling
behind me. Feeling the heat on the back of my neck, I glanced quickly
over my shoulder and then, as the flame seared my cheek, I scrambled
out of there on hands and knees.</p>

<p>Clear of the wreck, I got to my feet and looked around. A small
car was careening toward me from the direction of the Army hangar.
My first reaction was one of embarrassment at being caught by the
Army in such an undignified situation. When I looked again at the
airplane, it stood there without its engine, burning abaft the cockpit,
but headed in a direction opposite to that in which I had landed it.
Its engine lay a few yards beyond me, one propeller blade broken
off near the hub.</p>

<p>Well, that accounted for the crack-up. When the blade had let
go, several of the holding-down stud bosses had broken off, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
others had held the engine in the airplane. Then the rough landing
had sheared the others; the airplane, freed of its heavy noseweight,
had bounced into the air, done a split S, broken my safety belt, and
dropped me clear of the fire. Had it happened any other way, I
must surely have burned up before I could escape the flames.</p>

<p>I glanced at my hands and saw that the skin was burned deep
enough to expose the cords. I felt my face and found burns around
my lips and eyebrows; at least I would not be disfigured for life.
The careening Army car swung alongside with squealing brakes
and I climbed on its running board for a fast run back to Anacostia’s
sick bay. The soldier in the car said the broken propeller blade had
sailed right past him, screaming like a wild thing. Arrived at the
sick bay, I was hustled into a ward and told to lie down; the doctor
said I was suffering from shock. I lay down on the bunk awhile,
and when I looked up, Admiral Moffett stood in the door.</p>

<p>“Have you telephoned your wife?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Better do it yourself,” he ordered. “News of this will be all
over town. Save her the shock.”</p>

<p>But when I tried to get up, I couldn’t move. The admiral pushed
the bed toward the telephone. When I got our apartment, no prior
news had preceded me; my wife gasped and said she’d be right over.
The door opened and a doctor walked in to examine my hands.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll never use those again,” he said. Then he looked
up. “Can you stand a lot of pain?” he asked.</p>

<p>I had never had to stand much. The doctor said he’d try a treatment
developed in World War I, one using a solution of tannic acid. It
worked and today I have nothing to show for the experience save
a few minor scars. Meanwhile, the admiral sat there; for the first time
that I could recall, he seemed to droop.</p>

<p>“Things like this,” he said, “make you wonder if this cockeyed
game is worth the candle.” He paused.</p>

<p>“Well,” he added, standing up to leave, “there’s nothing much we
can do about it but play it out. The thing’s bigger than any of us
and we’re in it up to our necks.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_ELEVEN">CHAPTER ELEVEN<br>
A Lone Eagle Sets the Standard</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Among the aviation phenomena of the late 1920’s was the outbreak
of glorified stunt flying. Barnstormers and wing walkers of the
earlier half of the decade now began vying with one another on a
world-wide scale, competing for rich prizes offered by various personalities,
and for assorted motives. Some courageous souls, quite
unprepared, took off in the direction of the wide blue yonder and
never came back; others, more successful, returned to bask for a
while in the pitiless glare of publicity and then faded out.</p>

<p>But one day, while the whole world seemed to hold its breath and
to offer up a little prayer for him, a lone eagle soared out over the
broad Atlantic and, after thirty-three hours, let down through the
murk over Le Bourget, outside Paris. And after taxiing toward a
milling throng so dense he had to cut his engine to avoid injuring
someone with his propeller, he remarked, “I am Charles A. Lindbergh.”</p>

<p>Perhaps one measure of the character of this performance is the
fact that, to this day, in spite of all the strides in airplane development,
no person has sought to duplicate a solo flight from New York to
Paris.</p>

<p>The impact of Lindbergh’s flight on the progress of American
aviation is well known; it started an upsurge that carried aviation
over a dead center and started it spinning on its way. What is not
so well known is the underlying character of the man himself and
its influence on American air power. For, just as a community or an
enterprise mirrors the character of its pioneers, so has aviation taken
on some of the personalities of its immortals.</p>

<p>In BUAERO we were at first inclined to look at this last stunt as
more or less a lucky break, until Guy Vaughan came down to tell
us about the night take-off. Since Lindbergh was flying a Wright
Whirlwind engine, Guy had invited him to dinner. And while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and his wife, Helen, sat talking with Lindbergh, word came from
Dr. Kimball, the weather wizard, that things were clearing over the
Atlantic. The party drove out to the flying field and when the men
had pushed their way into the hangar to look for the <em>Spirit of St.
Louis</em>, the tiny ship was lighted by a single, dim carbon-filament
bulb—“so dim,” according to Guy Vaughan, “you had to strike a
match to see if it was burning.”</p>

<p>Outside the hangar, Dick Byrd, aided by his ample staff, had also
been making preparations. But Guy Vaughan and Charles Lindbergh,
using their own hands, topped off the fuel tanks of the <em>Spirit of St.
Louis</em> and started her rolling out onto the ramp. Guy ascribed Lindbergh’s
achievement to three things: he was the best pilot in the
world, he trusted nothing to anyone but himself, and he took no
unintelligent chances.</p>

<p>Admiral Moffett hailed Lindbergh’s accomplishment, but feared
the Army might make capital of it by persuading Lindbergh, an
Army Reserve officer, to say that his feat had obsoleted all navies.
Jerry Land, now our assistant chief, got a big kick out of the whole
thing; Lindbergh was his nephew. And then, as the flight proved to
be far more than just a seven days’ wonder and Lindbergh’s popularity
increased rather than diminished with the passage of time, all
sorts of people began getting into the act. When the word was
passed around that Lindbergh was coming home on the cruiser
<em>Memphis</em> and that he was writing a book to be called <em>We</em>, the Navy
began to take him very seriously. The Secretary of the Navy, Mr.
Curtis D. Wilbur, radioed Lindbergh on the <em>Memphis</em>, offering to
assign a naval officer as his technical advisor in the preparation of
the book. Lindbergh accepted the offer with alacrity, and I found
myself assigned to the detail. My job was to see that his book didn’t
sink the Navy with a fragmentation bomb.</p>

<p>On the day of Lindbergh’s arrival at the Navy Yard in Washington,
all the naval aviators in the vicinity were tolled off to act as a
guard of honor for him. I walked through the part, but was so
little interested that I neglected to attend the ceremonies at the
foot of the Washington Monument, and went home as usual for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
lunch. But after Lindbergh’s tour of the provinces, we began to
take notice; not only did his popularity increase, but he developed
a knack of being exactly on time for all ceremonies. I had noted,
during the time the <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em> had been in the hangar at
Anacostia, that Lindbergh himself had never failed to check every
detail of her preparations. Now his incredible on-time performance,
under trying conditions, seemed to bear out Guy Vaughan’s estimate;
he trusted no one but himself and was the best pilot in the
country. Then came the day when Charles Lindbergh returned to
Washington.</p>

<p>Jerry Land sent for me to tell me that Secretary Wilbur had placed
his yacht <em>Sylph</em> at Lindbergh’s disposal for a cruise down the Potomac
as far as Mount Vernon. A number of dignitaries, including Bill McCracken,
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Air; F. Trubee
Davison, Assistant Secretary of War for Air; Ed Warner, Assistant
Secretary of the Navy for Air; and a number of Slim Lindbergh’s St.
Louis backers, were to make the trip. The idea was to give Lindbergh
a lot of good advice on his future conduct and afterward we would
all adjourn to the house of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover
on S Street, where we would meet an agent of George Palmer Putnam,
prospective publisher of the book <em>We</em>. I was to go along on
the <em>Sylph</em> and then do my duty at the Hoover house.</p>

<p>On the junket down the river that day, I sat well out toward the
rail, watching Glenn Martin’s first T4M torpedoplane overhead with
its new Pratt and Whitney Hornet going through its one-hour, full-throttle
endurance trial. It was oppressively hot and I was nervous
about that engine; we thought Glenn had cowled it too close, trying
to get speed at the cost of cooling. Lindbergh sat inboard near a
cabin skylight, surrounded by important personages and looking
very boyish. And while I watched the T4M, listening to every engine
throb, I found myself beginning to take notice of the conversation
in which I had expected to find no interest.</p>

<p>The older, more experienced men agreed that Lindbergh had
done a swell job so far, but they reminded him that fame was fleeting;
if he expected to capitalize on his achievement, he must strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
while the iron was hot. Of course he shouldn’t try anything dizzy;
his job was to prove how safe aviation is. It seemed likely that he
might do a good motion picture, a sort of educational movie. He
could act out the early history of the flight: the meeting with his
backers, the days spent building his plane with Claude Ryan in
San Diego, his trials and tribulations, and finally the take-off and
landing at Le Bourget. It could be conservative and refined.</p>

<p>To this suggestion Lindbergh replied to the effect that he hated to
seem ungrateful, but he had no intention of going into the movies.
If he were to go into the movies, someone would try to make a
sheik out of him and he didn’t think he would make much of a
sheik. At this comment, I moved a little closer to the cabin skylight.</p>

<p>His advisors now shifted over to the possibilities of Slim’s becoming
interested in the air lines. After all, he’d had experience as
a mail pilot and could easily take over something big. Maybe Bill
Boeing of Seattle would be interested in taking him on—think of
all the publicity it would bring.</p>

<p>Lindbergh’s reply to this was again that he disliked appearing ungrateful.
It was true he had had some experience in air transport, but
he wasn’t too proud of the fact that he had had to parachute from
two of his planes and had lost them both. He didn’t know anything
much about transportation, and if he went into something he didn’t
know about he would likely make a fool of himself. He hoped that
from here on he might not make any bigger fool of himself than
he had made already.</p>

<p>It now began to appear that a lot more sense was coming from
the advised than from the advisors; I moved over and sat down near
Jerry Land, who grinned proudly at me. Overhead the Martin T4M
seemed to be droning along with confidence.</p>

<p>The third suggestion offered Lindbergh had to do with aircraft
manufacture. It was suggested that after all the publicity on the
<em>Spirit of St. Louis</em>, a lot of craft of that model might be sold. Perhaps
the men from St. Louis who had backed Lindbergh on the
flight to Paris might finance an aircraft manufacturing company in
St. Louis of which the young pilot might become the president.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Lindbergh shook his head quickly. He had a crazy idea that he
would like to have his Paris flight redound to the benefit of aviation
as a whole. If he went into manufacture, that would put him in
competition with others in the business; he didn’t want to compete
with them but rather to help the whole aviation game along. If the
flight was worth anything at all, he would like to see it advance aviation.
He didn’t appear to be interested in trying to make money out
of it.</p>

<p>By the time Charles Lindbergh had received his friends’ advice,
the Martin T4M had finished its run successfully and landed at
Anacostia. Soon the <em>Sylph</em> put back to the Navy Yard and we all
got into cars to ride up to Mr. Hoover’s house. Mrs. Hoover met
us at the door and showed most of the group out onto the porch.
Four of us remained behind to sit down around a table and hear
a report from the agent of Mr. George Palmer Putnam.</p>

<p>Charles Lindbergh took his seat at the head of a table. On his right
sat a keen young Army pilot, Lt. Robert Douglas, who had been a
student aviator with Lindbergh at Kelly Field. I sat down at Lindbergh’s
left while Mr. Putnam’s representative stood at the end of
the table opposite him. The man from Putnam’s held the galley proof
in his hand and displayed considerable pride over it. The galley had
been struck off in record time.</p>

<p>It seemed that the book really divided into three parts: the first
had to do with Lindbergh’s early life; the second part reviewed his
flight training, his barnstorming, and his experience as an air-mail
pilot; the third part, which covered the technical aspects of the New
York-Paris flight, had been prepared by someone in the publicity department
of the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, makers of the
engine of the <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em>.</p>

<p>The first part had been written by a journalist who had accompanied
Lindbergh on the trip home in the cruiser <em>Memphis</em>.
This section of the book was considered to be the meat of the cocoanut
and had been well advertised. It was the part of Lindbergh’s life
not already widely publicized. Mr. Putnam’s representative hoped
Colonel Lindbergh would not find it necessary to make changes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
it; its author would be disappointed. Of course, corrections of typographical
errors were in order but extensive revisions would delay
publication, and time was of the essence. Some parts of this section
might sound a little overdone to the colonel, but, after all, that was
what sold books and the publisher had already committed himself
to the public in forecasting a few sensations.</p>

<p>Lindbergh sat silent during this discourse and when the galley
was handed him, divided it into the three parts. The section on his
flying experience he handed to Bob Douglas; the technical section
he passed to me; his “early life” he kept to himself. There was a long
silence while we three scanned copy. I thumbed through a collection
of clichés designed to glorify the Wright Whirlwind, until I
found what I had been sent to look for. Sure enough, someone had
put into Lindbergh’s mouth a quote to the effect that his flight had
clearly shown that armies and navies might now be done away with,
and the moneys previously wasted devoted to an air force. After
a while Lindbergh glanced at Bob Douglas.</p>

<p>“How about your part, Bob?” he asked.</p>

<p>Bob Douglas saw nothing out of line in his section. It had been
developed largely from Lindbergh’s own reports of his parachute
drops from the mail planes in soupy weather, and was quite factual.
Lindbergh looked my way.</p>

<p>“To be wholly honest with you,” I said, “I was planted here to
see that you didn’t sink the whole Navy with one little bomb, and
here it all is, in quotes.” Lindbergh grinned. Some years later I was
to learn from a naval officer who accompanied Lindbergh home on
the <em>Memphis</em> that the young pilot had even then been disturbed by
the trend his book was taking and had accepted Secretary Wilbur’s
offer of technical assistance as a possible way out of his dilemma. Now
he listened as I read that part.</p>

<p>“If you think that is crazy,” he grinned, “just listen to this.” So
saying, he began to read aloud from his “early life.” As I recall what
he read, it stressed Lindbergh’s qualities as a daredevil, something
that certainly did not coincide with my own estimate of him. He was
bold, yes, courageous, undoubtedly, but he was the most painstakingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
accurate and precise young pilot I had yet encountered, and
these qualities, combined with his unique flying skill, had made it
possible for him to undertake the impossible, without being a daredevil.
Now as he read the passages, Mr. Putnam’s representative
nervously interrupted him to interpose the publisher’s point of view;
this treatment was all just a part of the publisher’s job; you had to
do it, or the book just would not sell. Lindbergh turned his clear
eyes on me.</p>

<p>“If you were in my place, Commander,” he inquired, “what
would you do?” The room was still as I pondered this question. We
could hear voices and laughter from the others of the party as they
enjoyed their lemonade out on the porch.</p>

<p>“Colonel Lindbergh,” I replied, “I don’t believe anyone but you
yourself can write <em>We</em>.”</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation he turned to the man from Putnam’s.
“That confirms a decision I had already taken on the <em>Memphis</em>,”
he said simply. “I’m sorry about all the work that has been
done, but it just can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>And Lindbergh did go off to Harry Guggenheim’s place on Long
Island, and he did write <em>We</em>, all except the final portion which was
clearly set apart as the work of Fitzhugh Green. And if fewer copies
were sold because the book did not set the world on fire, at least its
character was consistent with that of its author. I understand that
Lindbergh saw that the journalist, who had done his best under
trying circumstances, received full compensation for his unused
work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Charles A. Lindbergh had become for me the personification
of the spirit of aviation. Young, courageous, daring, yet
painstaking, competent, and proficient in his art, he had integrity and
that quality so rare in this era of rampant materialism, Christian unselfishness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWELVE">CHAPTER TWELVE<br>
A Change in Status</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">As the summer of 1927 came to a close, I began to sense that my
own work in BUAERO was coming to its end. The fact was crystallized
for me one evening when Fred Rentschler, Chance Vought, my
wife, and I sat out on the little balcony of our apartment at 2301
Connecticut Avenue, watching the shadows fall. Fred and Chance
had had dinner with us and we could hear the clatter of dishes in
the pantry as the maid of all work finished her chores. For when the
visiting firemen came to town, we either had dinner with them
downtown somewhere or they with us in the apartment. We
balanced the social obligations that way.</p>

<p>Our apartment looked out over Rock Creek Park and across the
Memorial Bridge toward Wardman Park, and the tiny balcony was
the one cool spot in it. In an open space among the trees stood a
riding school that was reminiscent of that avid horseman, Billy
Mitchell. And though he had lost out in his fight, his spirit still
haunted aviation and would continue to do so for all time. He had
created the opportunity on which Admiral Moffett had capitalized,
and people like Fred Rentschler and Chance Vought had founded
their businesses. Now Fred Rentschler, whose consuming passion was
business, was talking about it.</p>

<p>“This aviation business,” he was saying, “is like no other business
in the world.”</p>

<p>Chance Vought, sitting with his feet on the porch rail, glanced
skeptically at him; Chance delighted in debunking Fred’s somewhat
ponderous deductions.</p>

<p>“Whoever said it was a business?” he demanded. “The best you
can say for it is that it’s the ‘Aviation Game’; but it’s still a lousy
racket.” A pained expression crossed Fred’s serious face.</p>

<p>“Aviation is no longer a game or a racket,” he insisted. “It’s
serious business and the sooner some of you airplane wood butchers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
wake up to that fact, the better.” Chance winked at me and then
closed his eyes. He would snore during Fred’s discourse on a pet
subject, but would probably come to life in time to put the clincher
on the evening’s lesson.</p>

<p>Fred stressed the fundamental difference between the airplane and
other mechanisms. Most things produced in factories would wear
out in time and replacement furnished the manufacturer with a
continuing source of business. The airplane, on the other hand,
would never wear out; the high quality required for dependable
service meant that the goods would last forever. The only sources
of business were expansion and crash losses, and even these were
limited. In other words, even while the aircraft manufacturer must
strive to increase his quality in the interest of safety, in the process
he works himself out of production.</p>

<p>There appeared to be only one solution to this problem, and that
was the factor of obsolescence. In things like clothing, or automobiles,
or what have you, the trick was to so modify the styling
as to keep the customer “just enough dissatisfied with what he has to
persuade him to buy something new.” Fred ascribed this precept
to his friend “Boss” Kettering, of General Motors.</p>

<p>But the factor of styling, so important in some lines, had no bearing
in aviation. Here performance was the key to progress: in military
aircraft it was speed, climb, and ceiling; in air transport it was dollars
per ton-mile. And the degree to which this last factor was important
to the commercial airlines depended upon the intensity of
economic competition between them.</p>

<p>Bill Boeing, for instance, might have continued to use the war-surplus
Liberty-engined DH’s indefinitely, had not competition for
the air-mail contract forced him to risk a low bid and then build new
aircraft to meet his own standards. And so price competition, which
many were beginning to think was cutthroat and destructive, was
over-all, the key to progress in aeronautics.</p>

<p>The engine manufacturer, for instance, must experiment with new
ideas, conduct research into strange fields, and come up with something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
so economical that the airline operator can’t get along without
it. That will obsolete his airplanes, retire them to some embryonic
service that cannot yet afford new types, and force him to
introduce the newest and latest models—or else go out of business.
Competition, Fred insisted, was not destructive, but creative; it was
tough on the one who lost his shirt, but favorable to the public at
large.</p>

<p>Fred went on to develop the vast difference between the volume-producing
industries, where low first cost was the incentive, and the
aircraft industry, where low operating cost was the real criterion.
The airline operator could afford to pay a high price for high
quality aircraft, provided he reduced his operating costs enough
to absorb the first cost in a reasonable time. The whole character
of the two types of industry differed, and neither could expect to
do the other’s job. Technological development was the key to the
economic security of an enterprise like aviation. The way to keep
in the forefront was to stress your engineering; once you got behind
you could never catch up, unless the other fellow broke a leg
and fell down. Yes, he thought, this aviation was a funny business.
At this remark, Chance Vought woke up.</p>

<p>“The thing that is funny about it,” he said sleepily, “is that it has at
last become a business.”</p>

<p>I sat looking out over Rock Creek Park as it faded into the shadows.
The conversation had pointed up a new situation in my own affairs.
If aviation was now a business, then my job here was finished. You
could hardly have called it that three and a half years ago, and the
time had come for me to go to sea, lest some Selection Board pass
me by. I’d go see Admiral Moffett in the morning.</p>

<p>But in the morning the admiral was, as usual, one jump ahead of
me. I found a note on my desk instructing me to see him the first
thing. In his corner office he waved a letter at me, one scrawled in
longhand in the bold writing of Rear Adm. Joseph M. Reeves, Commander,
Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet. It was dated at San Diego,
California, on the <em>Langley</em>, and it took note of the fact that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
carriers <em>Saratoga</em> and <em>Lexington</em> were scheduled to join the fleet in
a year or so. His chief of staff, Karl Smith, was ill and he needed a
relief for him. He asked if I could be made available.</p>

<p>“Bull” Reeves was a distinguished officer and an able commander.
Only a year or two earlier he had dropped in on me in the Engine
Section to inquire if I thought he should accept an invitation to
join the aeronautic organization and go to Pensacola for instruction
with the ultimate idea of succeeding to command of the Aircraft
Squadrons, Battle Fleet. He had graduated from Annapolis into
the old Engineer Corps but later, upon amalgamation with the line,
had qualified for command. A hero of Naval Academy football, he
had been on duty at Annapolis as an instructor while I had been a
midshipman, and he had been rated “white” by all hands—the highest
commendation an officer could earn from the brigade. During the
Spanish American War, he had made a name for himself in the
engine room of the old <em>Oregon</em> in her dash around the Horn. Admiral
Moffett was smiling at my obvious satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he remarked, “you should be a big help to me out there.”</p>

<p>I put in a request for a month’s leave and bought tickets for my
wife and myself on the Panama-Pacific liner, <em>Mongolia</em>, sailing direct
for San Diego via the Panama Canal. We sailed from New York
where Fred Rentschler, Chance Vought, Guy Vaughan, and many
other friends in the aircraft industry saw us off. After a lovely cruise
through the Caribbean and the transit of the Canal, we headed north
for the West Coast and San Diego, where my wife and I had first
set up housekeeping at the Coronado Hotel, while I served my tour
of duty in the old Pacific Torpedo Flotilla. It was there we had made
our first contact with aviation.</p>

<p>When the <em>Mongolia</em> pushed her nose into San Diego harbor that
morning late in October of 1927, the bright sun glittered on the
white sands of North Island just as it had done some fifteen years
earlier when we had last looked upon this pleasant scene. Meanwhile,
however, North Island itself had undergone change. Then it had
been a flat, brush-covered expanse on which we had hunted jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
rabbits; now a latticed airship mooring mast thrust its height above
a cleared surface, and white hangars lined the shores of West Beach.
The mooring mast, located there as a haven for Admiral Moffett’s
rigid airships, lay down near the entrance to the ship channel; the
hangars, intended for heavier-than-air craft, faced across the bay to
San Diego or across Spanish Bight to Coronado Island’s bungalows
and cottages. The ancient Hotel del Coronado, with its white sides
and red-pinnacled roofs reminiscent of the lush days of the land-and-railroad
boom, still dominated the bright scene.</p>

<p>As our ship nosed into the pier on the San Diego side, we could
look back at North Island and the Naval Air Station where the experimental
carrier <em>Langley</em>, alongside her dock, filled the immediate
foreground, and the tower of the yellow stucco mission-type Administration
Building pierced the blue heavens. Here, less then
twenty years earlier, had stood the tent hangars of the pioneer Army
and Navy aviation schools, the one operated under the supervision
of the Wright Brothers, the other by Glenn Curtiss. Here too had
been born the early rivalries that still dominated the aircraft establishment,
a pattern of Army versus Navy, and of manufacturer
versus manufacturer, that had put the spark in the development of
a new art.</p>

<p>Back there, student pilots had taken off at the crack of dawn in
their powered box kites to get in their flight time before the gentle
southwesterlies could interfere with their training. And if, perchance,
a student like my classmate “Spig” Herbster, of the Wright
camp, were forced down on the harbor by a failure of the tricky
engine of his seaplane, another student like Jack Towers, of the
Curtiss camp, waiting for just such an opportunity, would literally
fly to his rescue—for the benefit of thrilling headlines in that enterprising
newspaper, <cite>The San Diego Union</cite>. To us salts of the
Destroyer Flotilla, moored alongside the ferry slip or the “Spreckles
Dock,” accustomed to night torpedo tactics on the high seas off
Coronado Island, the whole thing had looked a bit silly. But to the
aviators, news headlines had been the breath of life ever since that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
at Kittyhawk when the wise money in the public press had refused
to print the news of the first flight because it was too smart to fall
for such a hoax.</p>

<p>Now that same Jack Towers was serving as captain of the first
flattop, the <em>Langley</em>, a vessel named for the professor who had failed
to fly, and I recalled the <em>Langley</em> when she had been commissioned as
the collier <em>Jupiter</em> at the Mare Island Navy Yard, under command of
Comdr. Joseph M. Reeves. The <em>Langley</em> had a revolutionary power
plant, the electric drive, and had been equipped with a forest of
masts and booms designed to fuel battleships at the rate of 500 tons
of coal per hour. Today, fuel oil had replaced coal in all naval vessels
and the <em>Langley</em> masts had been leveled to make room for a flat
landing area for aircraft. And I, who had set out to become a gunnery
officer but had been converted into a mechanical engineer, was now
a naval aviator. Well, the new job seemed to have possibilities, but
just how far-reaching they would prove to be, I didn’t even dream.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_THIRTEEN">CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br>
A Salt’s Solution</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">When, next morning, I buckled on my dress sword and reported
at the Naval Air Station, I found Admiral Reeves had gone to Denver
to make a speech at the Navy Day celebration there. Then, since
Captain Towers was senior officer present afloat, I walked down the
<em>Langley</em> dock to pay my respects to him. The moment I stepped over
the rail onto the steel-decked passageway leading aft under the
landing platform, I recognized the unmistakable signs of a “smart
ship.” Freshly scrubbed paint and gleaming brightwork told its own
story. And before the winter had passed, I would learn just how smart
the <em>Langley</em> really was. For Jack Towers, the naval aviator, was
one of the best ship handlers in the whole service. He greeted me
outside his cabin and promptly asked me to stay for lunch.</p>

<p>Jack Towers, one of the real pioneers of American aviation, was
the acknowledged leader of the younger generation. He had served
with distinction in World War I as a member of Admiral Sims’s
staff in London, and though some of his contemporaries resented
his tendency to adopt English mannerisms, his juniors swore by
him. Now he invited some of his department heads, old friends of
mine, like Pete Mitscher, Monty Montgomery, and Bobby Moulton,
to join us for a bull fest. And hardly had we sat down around the
mess table before I found myself in the middle of the big issue of
the moment.</p>

<p>My personal situation was complicated by the fact that I was a
newcomer to aviation and now, by seniority and assignment, in a
position of authority over such old-timers as were gathered around
the table. No doubt they thought my qualification as naval aviator
had been donated by Admiral Moffett, and discounted my flying
ability accordingly. With this in mind I had sought to tread softly
through the lunch, but the issue now raised must be met head on.</p>

<p>It developed that Admiral Reeves held curious notions about carrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
tactics. He was insisting that a 500-foot, 10,000-ton vessel like
the <em>Langley</em> could earn her salt only by operating sufficient aircraft to
make her an effective military instrument. He had mentioned thirty-six
planes, or two full fighter squadrons, as the minimum complement.
But <em>Langley</em> officers had crystallized the opinion that not more
than a third as many, say twelve airplanes, could be flown off the
<em>Langley</em> and received on board without hazard to the lives of pilots.
That key factor of safety had been argued out in conferences but
“Bull” Reeves had stood pat. The <em>Langley</em> officers, now concerned,
put the clincher on me.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you,” someone said, while the Filipino mess attendants
passed the coffee.</p>

<p>“How come?” I inquired in some surprise.</p>

<p>“As chief of staff,” someone replied, “you’ve got to prevent the
admiral making this mistake.” In the silence that followed I realized
that on my first day in the Aircraft Squadrons we had already pointed
up an issue between the <em>Langley</em> officers and the admiral’s flag. The
fat was in the fire.</p>

<p>“As I understand my job,” I said, trying to choose the right words,
“it is to help the Old Man carry out his program, not hinder him.”</p>

<p>After lunch they showed me the slow-motion movies of carrier
landings; not the successful ones, but the crack-ups. These ranged
from simple landing-gear collapses to rolling off the deck and over
the side into the sea. As we broke up, Bobby Moulton came
forward with that glint in his eye that characterized the peculiar
brand of humor that permeates naval aviation.</p>

<p>“We’re qualifying the new class of carrier pilots next week,” he
grinned. “You can get yours in before the admiral gets back. Meet
me Monday morning down at the West Beach and we’ll put you over
the jumps.”</p>

<p>Not too many pilots had qualified for deck landings back there
in 1927. The <em>Langley</em> could make only twelve knots, and her deck
was so narrow a pilot could not see it behind the engine. He could
barely see the signalman out on his platform, and even with a good
landing, failures of the airplane or the arresting gear could make him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
trouble. We used Vought UO’s with arresting hooks hung under
their tails to catch the crosswires, and cross-axle hooks, long since
abandoned, to catch the fore and aft wires.</p>

<p>Three of us constituted the next class. After three days of preliminary
instruction on a simulated flight deck at Ream Field, primarily
to familiarize us with the flag signals, we went aboard. On the
way down the bay, a flock of sea gulls followed in our wake, beady
eyes alight for possible garbage, and since they constituted a flight
hazard, Emile Chourré, a veteran carrier pilot, perched aft on the
signal platform to practice his antiaircraft marksmanship by working
on the gulls with a BB gun.</p>

<p>Outside Point Loma the first pilot off—a youngster who had
been as hot as a firecracker at Ream Field—went haywire, and after
washing out his landing gear was ordered back to the air station
where he made a safe belly landing in a shower of sand while surrounded
by crash trucks, fire engines, and ambulances. My place was
second in the line and, as I scrambled into the cockpit and looked
down into the nettings where the whole ship’s company had assembled
in the hope of seeing a brass hat roll over the side, I thanked
my stars that the one thing I could do well with an airplane was to
set it gently back on the ground. And so closely did I concentrate on
the business in hand that I lost track of my landings and came to
only when Tiny Sullivan, a 300-pound chief and an old friend,
shook hands with himself as I jolted aboard for the tenth and final
landing. Climbing from the cockpit I thumbed my nose at Bobby
Moulton and waddled triumphantly toward the disappointed sailormen
in the nettings.</p>

<p>While waiting for Admiral Reeves to return from Denver and his
Navy Day speech, I familiarized myself with the local setup. The
Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet, was a part of the battle-fleet organization
whose backbone was a dozen battleships that based behind
the breakwater ninety miles farther north at San Pedro or Long
Beach, and exercised in the open sea nearby. Duty in the organization
constituted “sea duty” but the aircraft squadrons were based on
shore at the San Diego Air Station. Nominally assigned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
<em>Langley</em> for duty, Admiral Reeves and his small staff were given
working quarters in a wing of the Administration Building. All save
the admiral lived ashore, either in Coronado or San Diego; the
admiral, during Mrs. Reeves’s absence in Switzerland, lived in a
room off the corner office assigned to him. My office was next to his
in the opposite corner of the wing. The air station, built to conform
to local architecture, was surrounded by pleasant lawns and attractive
plantings. It provided operating facilities and repair shops for FLEET
AIR, and while under a separate command, had established a reputation
for cheerful cooperation, a circumstance not often encountered
in the naval establishment.</p>

<p>The admiral had built up his staff from among the personnel of
his squadrons. His operations officer, Frank D. Wagner, more commonly
known as “Honus,” had come up from Fighting One, the
swank combat squadron with a reputation for high hat that one day
gave it a replica of a top hat for its squadron insignia. Frank had
dragged his feet on leaving Fighting One, but had brought to the
staff a unique appreciation of the squadron point of view. Under
Admiral Reeves’s watchful eye, he had conducted the tactical exercises
of the summer concentration, and evolved some advanced
tactical concepts for air combat. The admiral’s flag secretary was
Seth Warner; his flag lieutenant, Les Arnold; and his radio officer,
Gordon Rowe. I, as his chief of staff, would supervise the administrative
functions and have general charge of matériel.</p>

<p>The aircraft squadrons themselves were in the process of organization.
The twelve battle wagons at San Pedro operated three Voughts
apiece, and since the battleships constituted three divisions, their aircraft
formed three squadrons of the observation wing. There were
no facilities at San Pedro for aircraft operations, so the observation
wing based at San Diego except when needed aboard their ships for
gunnery or the monthly fleet tactical exercises. During the summer
months, when personnel shifts took place, all aircraft based at San
Diego for the summer concentration period, where they broke in
new crews and tried out new air tactics under Wagner.</p>

<p>Squadrons were also being assembled for the carriers. <em>Langley</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
units based full-time at San Diego and carried out their protracted
gunnery schedules over nearby areas. Some <em>Lexington</em> squadrons
were being gradually assembled at the Naval Air Station at Norfolk,
Virginia, while the <em>Saratoga</em> units were being brought together
at San Diego. These squadrons would be equipped with the new
air-cooled fighters and torpedo bombers we had been developing
at BUAERO and manned with new pilots then under training at
Pensacola. The whole organization, under the leadership of Admiral
Reeves, must be rounded out and trained during the next few
years.</p>

<p>The admiral had always been “Bull” Reeves to his contemporaries,
from the day when he had created the first football headgear so
that he might get into the Army-Navy football game after a serious
head injury. His juniors in aviation now called him “Billy Goat”
because he wore one of the few beards then extant in the Navy. This
beard was a lovely gray Vandyke which, with the admiral’s shell-pink
complexion, gave him an air of grave distinction that quite
belied an uproarious sense of humor. He had a deep, vibrant voice and
he spoke with great eloquence—a fact he ascribed to his having once
studied for the ministry. Standing before an assembly of his brother
officers he could expound the weightiest tactical or strategic doctrines
in an entertaining and enlightening manner, speaking always
with the obvious relish of a man engaged in an undertaking at which
he knows he is competent. He differed from Admiral Moffett in
almost every characteristic, but especially in his logical, measured
approach to a problem. Though trained as an engineer, he had
specialized in tactics and strategy and had brought to these subjects
an orderly but very active mind. Even as I slid into the routine
of my new job, I looked forward with impatience to the Old Man’s
return.</p>

<p>On the first morning that we faced each other across the desk in
his bare office, Admiral Reeves raised the question of the <em>Langley’s</em>
reluctance to expand her operating complement. Entertaining as he
did a high regard for Captain Towers both as a seaman and as a
leader, and having in mind the initiative with which Jack had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
pioneered naval aviation, the admiral surmised that the long list of
casualties among pilots had tended to overemphasize the hazards of
flying off carriers. The fleet problem that was scheduled for the
coming spring would offer an opportunity for an air attack on Pearl
Harbor. In light of the probable arrival of the big carriers the following
year he wanted to try out some of his ideas on the <em>Langley</em>, if
only on a small scale. However, the scale proposed by that vessel was
too small for any use at all. Our job was to find some way around the
difficulty.</p>

Germ of a Big Idea</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">When later the Commander in Chief, Adm. Louis R. de Steiguer,
once my captain on the <em>Old Ark</em>, finally released his statement of
the fleet problem, the attention of all hands was focused on the
forthcoming Hawaiian cruise. In April the following year, 1928,
the fleet would rendezvous at San Francisco to sail from there for
the joint Army-Navy exercises. In preparation for the maneuvers,
each unit commander was called upon to submit his own “estimate
of the military situation” and to formulate his own decisions and his
operation orders. The fleet staff, after analyzing the several solutions,
would promulgate the commander in chief’s orders. In FLEET
AIR, as the Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet, were locally known,
we planned to close the first phase of the exercises with a dawn attack
on Pearl Harbor by planes launched from the <em>Langley</em>.</p>

<p>Appreciating that a dozen tiny fighters in competition with the
great guns of the ponderous battle wagons would make little impression
on Pearl Harbor, the admiral undertook to expand greatly
the number of aircraft to be flown off the <em>Langley</em>. To provide living
accommodations for their crews he instructed Captain Towers to
request the Mare Island Navy Yard to undertake alterations to the
vessel during her forthcoming annual overhaul. To increase the fire
power of our embryonic air force, presently confined to a pair of
thirty-caliber machine guns each, we started our squadrons training
in a new tactic.</p>

<p>Dive bombing, first tested against Nicaraguan rebels by the
United States Marines, had been further developed against naval
targets by Fighting Five, a <em>Lexington</em> squadron then being assembled
at Norfolk, Virginia. Admiral Reeves waxed enthusiastic over this
idea, primarily because it concentrated the attack upon objectives
located at the surface, instead of wasting energy on the usual dogfights
between knights of the air. Frank Wagner, after scurrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
around to lease all suitable training areas in the vicinity, soon had airplanes
diving all over the San Diego hinterland.</p>

<p>In order to remove some of the hazards of operating carrier land
planes over the sea, we began training our two auxiliary vessels, the
former mine planter <em>Aroostook</em> and the sweeper <em>Teal</em> as “plane
guards” for the <em>Langley</em>. For protection against losses incident to
distant water landings, we equipped all planes with rubber flotation
bags and gear to inflate them, when necessary, with bottled gas.
Finally we borrowed two fast destroyers from the local squadrons
under command of Adm. Thomas J. Senn. Here, though we little
appreciated it at the time, was the germ of the big idea of the carrier
task force.</p>

<p>With a view to further speeding sea rescue, we asked BUAERO
to undertake for us the development of a single-float amphibian gear,
interchangeable with the seaplane float of the Vought Corsair. To
navigate a single-seater without radio out of sight of the carrier, to
engage in combat and then return to a pin-point contact with a roving
carrier, demanded real skill. In order to provide some sort of
homing device, our radio officer, Gordon Rowe, strung a loop of
wires between the wings of a Corsair, thus utilizing the loop-antenna
feature, then common in home radio sets. Rowe’s device, antedating
radar, was intended to avoid the possible loss of precious pilots and
planes but it also made the Corsair available as a liaison plane for
fighter tactics. With a good carrier-based amphibian we could extend
our control of combat units and, at the same time, release them
for safe long-range operations.</p>

<p>To gain experience from the Hawaiian cruise, Admiral Reeves
felt the <em>Langley</em> should operate at least two eighteen-plane fighter
squadrons as dive bombers together with six Vought Corsair two-seaters
for scouting, rescue, and radio liaison. While the <em>Langley</em>,
with the space available in her vast, empty coal bunkers, could easily
provide ample hangar space and crew’s quarters, the restricted area
of her flight deck and the limited capacity of her plane elevator introduced
serious limitations. How to spot forty-two airplanes on an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
area believed by <em>Langley</em> officers to be adequate for but twelve was
something of a problem.</p>

<p>While working on this, I proceeded on another project close to
my heart, a recommendation from FLEET AIR for a long-term
development and procurement program that would conform to the
one I knew to be under way in BUAERO. If we could eliminate
some of the local partisanship that frequently obscured the fundamentals
of such problems, we might facilitate engineering progress.</p>

<p>When I submitted my schedule to the admiral he approved all of
it save one critical item, the construction of an experimental two-seat
fighter. The idea had originated in World War I on the Western
Front, where the classic form of attack had been a dive out of the sun
onto the enemy’s tail, to shoot him down when he wasn’t looking.
Perhaps a tail gunner might guard a pilot from such surprise, but
Admiral Reeves would have none of the idea. He thought an alert
fighter pilot could do the job by twisting his neck. If he had to
lug an extra gun and tail gunner, he would impair the combat performance
of his airplane. Besides, during maneuvers, no rear gunner
could serve a gun. This was no snap judgment on his part; he had had
Wagner try it out during tactical exercises, using Voughts to simulate
two-seat fighters. In his judgment there could be no such thing
as a two-seat “fighter.”</p>

<p>Against such logic I could but argue that many officers in the
Bureau favored the project, among them Bruce Leighton, who, having
finished his tour at sea, was now head of the powerful Plans
Division. Failure to include his pet project in our recommendations
would stir up such a controversy as to hazard the entire program.
The admiral smiled at me.</p>

<p>“You’ve been with Moffett so long,” he chuckled, “that you’ve
begun to think like a politician yourself.” It being hopeless to argue
further with this forthright old sea dog, I modified the letter, knowing
full well that Bruce Leighton, who had fostered the air-cooled
engine against bitter opposition, would not readily abandon his pet
two-seat fighter. And so it proved. BUAERO and FLEET AIR<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
split wide open on this single controversial item with the result that
the rest of the program fell apart. Before long we were engaged in
acrimonious correspondence on almost every subject. Even engineering
needs politics for lubrication.</p>

<p>When the <em>Langley</em> returned from her overhaul, she brought more
trouble in her wake. The alterations for additional crew space had
not been approved. When the admiral learned this from Frank
Wagner his beard bristled and his eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“Instruct Fighting One and Fighting Six to assemble all aircraft
on the <em>Langley</em> dock,” he ordered. “Collect a dozen Vought Corsairs
and advise Captain Towers we will call on him after lunch. We’ll
soon see,” he added ominously, “just how many planes the <em>Langley</em>
can be made to operate.”</p>

<p>When, after lunch, the admiral with his staff bore down under all
plain sail upon the <em>Langley</em> dock, Captain Towers and his officers
met us at the gangway. The admiral, taking personal charge, soon
had Wagner and me helping the deck crews to spot planes closer and
closer together. When he had finished, he wrung from the <em>Langley</em>
officers their reluctant admission that forty-two airplanes might be
operated, but they expressed their firm conviction that it would be
dangerous. As the admiral swept off the flight deck in triumph, he
pointed up the moral in a strong, resonant voice.</p>

<p>“Most standards,” he said, “are limited by opinion or prejudice.
They break down under pressure. The function of a leader,” he
added, “is to generate the pressure.” Turning to me he continued,
“Please collect all the artificers in FLEET AIR, every carpenter’s
mate, shipfitter, and helper. Go in person aboard the <em>Langley</em> and
construct quarters for the plane crews.”</p>

<p>“Without authority from Construction and Repair?” I queried.</p>

<p>“Upon the authority of COMAIRONS,” he replied, “and,” he
added, “on my responsibility.”</p>

<p>Arriving at San Francisco, we found Chance Vought waiting with
a new Corsair single-float amphibian which he had personally
chaperoned all the way from Long Island City in a baggage car.
The Naval Aircraft Factory at Philadelphia later supplied two more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of a somewhat different design. After testing them, I came in for a
good deal of ribbing from <em>Langley</em> pilots who, like Chance, insisted
I had spoiled good airplanes by overloading them with junk. The
craft may have been “klucks” but they lifted a heavy load from the
staff conscience.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed on schedule with the aircraft squadrons ready in
all respects. Some of our wives, including mine, were to all sail later
on a passenger steamer from Los Angeles. With our convertible
coupe in the ship’s hold and my own recollections of an earlier visit
to Honolulu in the old Armored Cruiser Squadrons in mind, we
looked forward to a pleasant sojourn.</p>

<p>During passage, the fleet passed the steamer at sea, where the
wives got a close-up of the <em>Langley</em> launching and receiving planes.
We had been assigned a fixed station “6,000 yards astern of BAT
DIVS,” an order that irked the admiral no end. To launch and
receive aircraft, the <em>Langley</em> had to leave her station and head into
the wind, a fact that seemed to cause acute distress to those elements
of the fleet accustomed to cruising in precise formation.</p>

<p>On the slow journey westward, daily exercises, morning and
afternoon, developed our flight-deck technique to the ultimate. As
a plane floated in over the ramp, to drop into the gear and be brought
up with a jerk, squads of deck handlers swarmed out of the nettings,
cleared hooks from landing wires, caught wing tips, and hustled the
craft forward of the barrier, just in time to clear the gear for the next
plane, even then floating down the groove. It was Bull Reeves who
pressed always for more speed. Always quick to condemn a miscue
or commend smart action, he finally inspired the <em>Langley</em> officers
until they cut the take-off interval between planes down to ten
seconds and the landing intervals to thirty.</p>

<p>At the crack of dawn, one lovely Sunday morning, we headed
into the wind to launch aircraft for the assault on Pearl Harbor. We
had selected this day in the knowledge that the defenders, after the
usual Saturday night festivities, would be sleeping late.</p>

<p>First across the bow was Gerry Bogan of Fighting One; the rest
of his flock zoomed after him at ten-second intervals. Fighting Six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
followed, led by “Injun Joe” Tomlinson. Finally scouts and
amphibians roared into the air, leaving the deserted flight deck a
bleak expanse of silence. After their attack on Pearl Harbor, the
squadrons were to land ashore.</p>

<p>Our striking force, undetected by the defenders, caught Army
and Navy pilots flat on their backs in bed, just as their successors
were destined to be caught some thirteen years later on Sunday,
December 7. It now seems likely that the casual Japanese oil tanker
that managed always to find herself in the center of our operating
areas off San Pedro, or those “fishing” sampans that busied themselves
off Honolulu that very morning, later communicated our
movements to the Japanese high command. It was natural for their
admiralty to assume that we understood the import of the new
weapons we were exercising. They could not have believed the intelligence
that our own high command had so discounted the striking
power of aerial bombs and submarine torpedoes that they had
neglected to equip their vessels with adequate gun defenses. Recognizing
in FLEET AIR—as they surely did—a revolutionary instrument
of sea power, they sped their own development and hastened
to exploit it in the rapid expansion of their East Asia Co-prosperity
Sphere.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the Hawaiian exercises, we conducted
joint operations with local naval forces and with the Army, polishing
our flight techniques at sea. One day, a shift of wind, sweeping
yellow volcanic dust from an extinct crater, cut our surface visibility
to a dangerous low just after Gerry Bogan, with nine fighter bombers
from Fighting One, had roared over the bow to attack a distant
enemy fleet. Our worried staff found some comfort in the knowledge
that one of our radio-liaison Corsairs was supposed to be plane-guarding
the unit, ready to lead the flock back aboard after its mission
had been completed. But when we radioed the Vought, the
pilot reported he had lost the fighters. After homing the Corsair and
taking her aboard, we began really sweating it out, peering hopefully
into the yellow spaces, looking for Gerry Bogan. Finally at long last
came the drone of engines. One by one the planes lurched into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
gear and taxied forward. The admiral sent his orderly for Bogan.</p>

<p>“Where the hell have you been anyway?” he demanded with unwonted
truculence.</p>

<p>“Fightin’,” replied Gerry.</p>

<p>Years later when I read of Gerry Bogan’s fantastic exploits in the
Pacific, and especially Bill Halsey’s estimate of his courage, I recalled
this laconic yet complete answer—as well as the way it had parted
Bull Reeves’s whiskers in an appreciative grin.</p>

<p>At Pearl Harbor, one day, we got news of the arrival in San Francisco
of the long-awaited <em>Lexington</em>. She planned to proceed at once
to Honolulu on a trial run at thirty knots. Day by day we watched
her phenomenal performance, and we admired her from afar as she
anchored in triumph off Waikiki with Diamond Head as a fitting
backdrop. There her captain, Frank D. Berrien, welcomed us
warmly as we transferred aboard.</p>

<p>Whereas on the <em>Langley</em> COMAIRONS staff had perched under
the flight-deck ramp in temporary cubby holes hung as an afterthought
out over the stern, on the “<em>Big Lex</em>” the chief of staff rated
a living room, bedroom, and bath, a sumptuous suite in which I
rattled around like a single die in a wardroom dice box. Messing as
we did with the admiral in his big cabin, we luxuriated all the way
back to San Diego. There, anchored in the Roads, we found big
“<em>Sister Sara</em>” under the able command of Capt. John Halligan. Bull
Reeves’s two-starred flag floated over the world’s most powerful
carrier force, a smart outfit that already gave signs of great <em>esprit</em> in
the making.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a number of new aircraft and new pilots had been
assembling for the “summer concentration.” Our job now was to
whip the force into shape for the next fleet operation less than a year
away. Captain Towers turned over command of the <em>Langley</em> to
Capt. Arthur B. Cook, another good skipper, and now returned to
BUAERO to become Admiral Moffett’s Assistant Chief. We hoped
that the stresses and strains of the winter might not complicate our
affairs, for we already had a tough problem to solve in the relationship
between the carriers and their squadrons. The admiral held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
that the squadrons should base under him at San Diego and should
operate under his command in the monthly fleet tactical exercises;
some of the carrier officers, and singularly enough it was the naval
aviators now acting as ship’s officers, and not the line officers at all,
insisted that the squadrons should function with respect to the carriers
just as a turret crew works on a battleship. Aside from the fact
that it was impractical to base squadrons on carriers and train them
there without keeping the carriers continuously at sea, the introduction
of carrier skippers into the chain of command tended to
slow down air operations.</p>

<p>This was a conflict that raged even more bitterly as time went on
and especially after Capt. E. J. King took over command of the
<em>Lexington</em>. It was complicated by the <em>Langley</em> incident and worse still
by a political situation even then developing back in Washington.
Some of the high brass had gone gunning for Admiral Moffett’s
scalp—his term of office would expire in a year—and their candidate,
as yet unbeknownst to Bull Reeves, was Rear Adm. Joseph M.
Reeves.</p>

<p>As the net of complications began to tighten about us, I chafed
under them. To me it seemed that grown men ought to learn to bury
their pet prejudices and to move ahead on the big ideas in an orderly
and cooperative fashion. To Bull Reeves, an older, wiser, and always
more philosophical man, these conflicts all seemed part of a plan that
somehow produced the right answers where the apparently more
orderly processes finally created planned disorder.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_FIFTEEN">CHAPTER FIFTEEN<br>
Creation of Strategic Concept</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The return of FLEET AIR to San Diego coincided with the commencement
of the summer concentration period of 1928, and now
with the two big carriers <em>Lexington</em> and <em>Saratoga</em> anchored off
Long Beach, ninety miles to the north, their squadrons trained
ashore at North Island under the direct command of Admiral Reeves.
Scuttlebutt rumor had it that the next fleet problem would take
place off Panama early the coming year, and this directed all staff
efforts toward sound preparation for the big show. In all this we
felt a certain sense of urgency; now was the time to show the
battle wagons what we could do, and thus “sell aviation to the fleet.”
Underneath the daily routine we somehow sensed that we were dealing
with high destiny, though our course was never completely
clear. What ultimately developed was not the direct result of anyone’s
far-sighted vision; it just came naturally out of the conflict of
forces and events.</p>

<p>At that period, the Navy had settled down into a certain organization
and procedure that had evolved out of years of experience.
The fundamental concept of the fleet setup had been derived from
a somewhat shallow reading of Mahan and somewhat superficial
instruction at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.
Mahan, in the evolution of his thesis on sea power, had made a painstaking
analysis of history, and especially of naval history. Since he
studiously excluded theory and opinion, drawing his conclusions
from the record, he was able to present convincing evidence in
support of his thesis that victory in war and prosperity in peace have
always resided with that nation which controls communication by
sea. The foundation of sea power is maritime commerce.</p>

<p>The United States Naval War College at Newport held classes
in naval tactics and worked out tactical problems on the maneuvering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
board. For their precepts they naturally looked to Mahan’s classic
studies and thus became imbued with the tactics of the battle line as
employed by Nelson, the great English admiral. From a continued
emphasis on the battle line and a general understanding of the role
of sea power in history, it was easy to conclude that sea power and
the navy were synonymous. The modern counterpart of this loose
doctrine is the prevalent belief that strategic bombardment is air
power.</p>

<p>The administrative organization of the Battle Fleet revolved
around the battleships—the so-called “backbone of sea power.” The
big-gun carriers based at Long Beach behind the breakwater where
they found nearby plenty of sea room. The destroyer squadrons,
then called DESRONS, the submarine divisions, or SUBDIVS,
and the aircraft squadrons, or AIRONS, based on San Diego, ninety
miles further south. For purposes of administration and elementary
training, each of these units operated separately under the supervision
of the commander in chief. Once each month, the fleet as a
whole conducted combined tactical exercises off the coast. Yet even
here the forces operated largely under the command of their administrative
staffs. The idea of breaking up the several administrative
units and reassembling them as task organizations so constituted as to
bring to bear such a concentration of heavy guns, long-range torpedoes,
and mobile aircraft as appeared necessary to the accomplishment
of a particular mission had not as yet evolved. It was to grow
out of the peculiar conditions that prevailed in the aircraft squadrons:
the big carriers could find suitable anchorages and deep-water
operating areas only at Long Beach; their aircraft could find
adequate training and repair facilities only at the Naval Air Station,
San Diego.</p>

<p>It was customary to change personnel just before the concentration,
sending about half of them to “shore” or other duty, and receiving
a new batch of students from Pensacola to be trained “at sea.”
Half of the squadron officers changed at this time as well, a fact
that dictated a fresh start on fundamental tactics each year. In view
of this fact I determined upon a revolutionary procedure. Instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of accepting the ordinary run-of-the-mine officers sent to us by the
Bureau of Navigation for duty in certain specified units, we would
jump the gun and insist upon the right to select our own squadron
commanders and assign other officers to such squadrons as seemed
appropriate to us. When we suggested this selective process to Admiral
Reeves, he smiled tolerantly and invited us to go ahead, intimating
that we would be wasting our time. For the Bureau of Navigation
usually selected its officers and made its assignments with
little or no regard for their aptitude for the jobs in mind. Someone
had long ago worked out a system designed to expose every officer
to an equal amount of duty in every line, so as to afford him an
equal opportunity to advance in rank, whether or not he possessed
qualities of leadership.</p>

<p>But if the factor of leadership had fallen into low estate in Washington,
it still rated high in the aircraft squadrons. Frank Wagner
and I had observed the vast differences in character displayed by
ships and organizations, and had noted that each had seemed to take
on some of the personality and character of the man or men who had
founded it, and to retain that personality and character no matter
who had succeeded to command. If the U.S.S. <em>Taddlyadlie</em> started
out as a “smart ship,” she would always be a smart ship; and if the
U.S.S. <em>Tiddlywinks</em> started as a “madhouse,” her career would become
a series of variations of that theme. With that idea in mind,
we determined to give the aircraft squadrons a propitious start and
began some tall wangling to gain our ends. For this we brought two
powerful arguments to bear: the lives of pilots depended upon the
quality of the leaders; if we were to be held responsible, we must
have authority over our leadership selections. In our tough battle
against this leveling system we won every skirmish but one—a
squadron that suffered our only breakdown in morale.</p>

<p>While focusing attention on the quality of leadership of our
subordinates, we did a little soul searching of our own. The rapid
development of gadgetry in the Navy had tended to create a special
group of staff-officer specialists who had become “plank owners”
on various staffs. Thus the intricacies of steam engineering, or gunnery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
or radio communications, or what have you, had become so
mysterious to the average line officer that the specialists had taken
over a lot of authorities without accepting the corresponding responsibilities.
An admiral, for instance, might sign out a long-winded
technical document without being able to pronounce the words, or
he might let his radio officer sign the paper “by direction.” The
addressee would turn the masterpiece over to his radio officer for
reply, and thus accept responsibility for fundamental decisions
fogged up by technical jargon. Even Admiral Reeves had tended
to shift the administrative authorities to me and the operations to
Frank Wagner. But Frank and I determined to have none of that;
we directed these matters right back to the admiral.</p>

<p>Contrary to naval custom we sought to build up the admiral and
play ourselves down. For instance, after having prepared an order
for the Old Man’s signature, we would urge him to call a conference
of squadron commanders to indoctrinate them in his plan. A fine
speaker, one possessed of unusual knowledge of military history, of
policy, strategy, and tactics, he often held us spellbound by his entertaining
and instructive discourses spiced by keen wit. Wagner and
I would grasp every favorable occasion to suggest a commendatory
signal to a subordinate who had distinguished himself; similarly we
saw to it that the admiral got word of any complimentary comment
from his subordinates. In other words, we made it our first order of
business to develop loyalty both ways—up and down. The time soon
came when a squadron commander remarked, “If Bull Reeves told us
to fly into the side of a mountain, we’d fly—and likely come out safe
on the other side!”</p>

<p>We also gave critical attention to our own performance of staff
functions stressing especially our communications procedures and
techniques. On the matériel side we took extreme pains to train our
“mechs” and to emphasize the importance of preventive engineering.
Under this doctrine, it became the task of the maintenance
crews to discover incipient failures and correct them before they
could induce forced landings or other accident. Having good, sound,
new equipment to start with, we were able to reduce mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
failures almost to the vanishing point and to abolish them entirely
from over-water operations.</p>

<p>On the important morale side, Frank Wagner was the key to
success. Intimately acquainted with the younger pilots as he was,
and an active participant in their social affairs, Frank could watch
their reactions and recommend actions designed to keep them all
at a high pitch of enthusiasm. One day, after we had been pressing
hard toward perfection, Frank came to me with a long face; he
feared the kids were getting stale. He thought we should secure
all flying for several days and actually order the pilots off the station
and away from their jobs. When we went in to see the admiral,
concealing our misgivings as to this revolutionary idea, the Old Man
threw back his head and parted his beard in a laugh that must have
carried clear down to the <em>Langley</em> dock.</p>

<p>“Go to it!” he shouted. “And Wagner,” he added, “a little visit
across the Mexican border to Tijauna might help you get a smile
back on your own face.”</p>

<p>As the summer developed, two special projects helped bring our
new outfits to a high degree of precision: the city of San Diego
planned to dedicate Lindbergh Field, and the city of Los Angeles
would be host to the national air races in dedication of Mines Field.
This gave the staff an opportunity to keep the squadrons practicing
their close formations, a drill that tended to bore them; they preferred
the dive-and-zoom of practical combat exercises. But now,
returning from the many operating areas Frank had established in
the back country, they passed in review before the admiral’s critical
eye, flying wing-and-tail in tight parade formations. Tommy Tomlinson,
with the first section of his squadron, began practicing section
acrobatics, putting on a rhythmic show of breathtaking formation
loops, rolls, and dives.</p>

<p>At the dedication of Lindbergh Field, the overcast lay so close
to the surface that, save for fine air discipline, we should have had
to call off our participation. Instead, we flew some four hundred
fleet aircraft in a thrilling fly past, at low altitude, with the tails of
the formations lost in the clouds. Later at the National Air Races in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Los Angeles, Tommy’s Three Sea Hawks stopped the show with
their precision acrobatics. The Army responded with their Three
Musketeers. When one of their team was unfortunately killed in an
accident, Charles Lindbergh, stepping into the lead position, gave
the crowd a sample, not alone of his own flying, but also of the
quality of his teamwork and personal leadership.</p>

<p>It was in the National Air Races, too, that the air-cooled engine
finally triumphed completely over liquid-cooled. A year earlier,
Claire Egtvedt had come down from Seattle to get our ideas on the
specifications for a new plane to replace his current production F3B.
Primed by me, the admiral had given him the requirements for what
had since become the first experimental single-seat fighter bomber,
the XF4B. Flown by Tom Jeter in the free-for-all pursuit race, this
airplane won handily, running away from the special souped-up
liquid-cooled entries. Later in a special event promoted by Bill
Boeing, a race to altitude from a standing start, Mort Seligman, in
the XF4B, executed a triumphant loop over the T4M station ship
cruising at 10,000 feet above the thronged grandstand, and dived
back onto the field before the nearest competitor could climb to the
target. Jim Fechet, Chief of the Army Air Service, followed Bill
onto the field to get the Army’s first order in ahead of the Navy. In
subsequent years this basic airplane served both Army and Navy, the
one as P-12, the other as F4B, with variations to suit the special requirements
of each.</p>

<p>Returning to San Diego, we spent the autumn of 1928 at gunnery
training, interspersed by monthly tactical exercises with the fleet.
All three carriers and their squadrons operated in conjunction with
cruisers, destroyers, and submarines against a simulated enemy battle
line and in support of our own “backbone.” Yet even as we developed
intricate joint attacks under this time-honored doctrine,
we in COMAIRONS began to flirt with a revolutionary concept:
maybe our task force could defeat the battle line singlehanded!
From here to the fantastic proposal to use battle wagons in support
of aircraft carriers was a terrific mental leap. When the detailed
plans for the winter exercises became available, we drew a long
breath and took it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_SIXTEEN">CHAPTER SIXTEEN<br>
Maneuver for Position</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">When the commander in chief released the preliminary statement
of the 1929 fleet problem, we in COMAIRONS staff wore broad
smiles of satisfaction. For while the exercises contemplated a conventional
assault on the defenses of the Panama Canal, the problem
was so stated as to convince us that the high command
was beginning at last to recognize the role of the carrier in
warfare at sea. A “red” fleet, comprising the modern battleships
then based in the Pacific with its accompanying submarines, destroyers,
and train, moving into the Gulf of Panama with the object of
attacking the Canal, would be opposed by a friendly “blue” fleet
which had just transited the Canal and moved out into the Gulf
to defend it. The blue fleet comprised the vessels of the scouting
fleet, then based in the Atlantic but reinforced by the <em>Lexington</em>
and <em>Langley</em> from the “battle fleet” of the Pacific. This gave the
defenders an air force comprising all the Army and Navy shore-based
aircraft in the Panama Canal Zone, the aircraft of the scouting
fleet then based on my old seaplane tender, the <em>Wright</em>, and
the planes of the <em>Langley</em> and <em>Lexington</em>; it left to the attackers the
<em>Saratoga</em> and her planes, under the command of Admiral Reeves.</p>

<p>In the past, these Panama maneuvers had been stereotyped battle-line
tactics with the battle wagons steaming majestically behind a
destroyer-laid smoke screen while bombarding the Canal with their
turret guns at maximum range. After the fleet had fired a few blank
charges or “primers” to simulate long-range attack and its airplanes
had been “shot down” by the local defenders, the vessels would proceed
to their anchorage in the Bay of Panama and all hands would go
ashore for a big bust at the Union Club. Later there would be a
“critique” in which the high rankers would stand up before a congregation
of Army-Navy officers and alibi their failures, or try to
impress their personalities upon the assembly. Following this, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
social whirl would begin and fleet grand tactics would be put aside
until another year.</p>

<p>This time we proposed to spring something new. Instead of tying
<em>Big Sara</em> to the apron strings of the battle wagons, we would propose
that she be detached from the slow elements and sent on a wide
southerly detour past the Galápagos Islands, along the north coast
of South America, into the Gulf of Panama, through the screen of
defending vessels, and up to a point where we might launch a predawn
sneak attack on the Canal locks. The single drawback to our
plan was the fact that the only vessel with enough high-speed cruising
endurance to accompany <em>Big Sara</em> was the light cruiser <em>Omaha</em>,
flagship of Adm. Thomas J. Senn, Commander, Destroyer Squadrons.
However, Admiral Reeves and Admiral Senn were warm
personal friends. Capt. Harold R. Stark, Admiral Senn’s chief of
staff, and I were on terms of warm regard. We decided to chance
submitting the fantastic proposal that a senior unit commander be
deprived of his flagship to plane-guard <em>Big Sara</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, storm clouds had begun to darken our political horizon.
With the close of the concentration period, we had come face
to face with the moot question as to the relationships of carrier
squadrons to their carriers. Based on our experience we prepared
a letter recommending such changes in the Navy Regulations as
would permit the commanding officers of carriers to exercise administrative
control over their squadrons, yet still preserve their
freedom for assignment by the admiral to task forces and give to him
the tactical command. By this time, Capt. E. J. King had assumed
command of the <em>Lexington</em>, and Capt. Harry E. Yarnell of the
<em>Saratoga</em>. Both were extremely able men but with quite different
temperaments. Captain King had positive ideas for which he fought
with determination; Captain Yarnell, while equally clear in his
opinions, approached the problem with judicious moderation. In
both the <em>Lexington</em> and the <em>Saratoga</em>, the positive convictions that
the squadrons should be treated like gun divisions as an integral
part of the ship rested largely with the old-line aviators running the
air departments. And so we had a major difference of opinion in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
which senior naval aviators battled to keep the squadrons subservient
to the carriers while we line officers, basing our convictions on practical
experience, battled to keep the aircraft squadrons free. On the
staff, we argued that the carriers existed for the squadrons; on the
ships, they seemed to think it was the other way around. This conflict
came at a time when our Washington fences were none too
secure.</p>

<p>The fact that Admiral Moffett would complete his second full
term as a bureau chief early in the coming year had intensified the
efforts of his enemies to deny him reappointment. Their candidate
for his relief was Admiral Reeves, and as a palliative they suggested
that Admiral Moffett take over command of the Aircraft Squadrons,
Battle Fleet. To us on the staff, the whole thing looked like a
tempest in a teapot and we, of course, took no position. Admiral
Reeves busied himself with preparations for the fleet problem and
expressed amusement over Washington politics. Then came the
news that some of the boys in the Bureau now had a foot out for
me, and had represented me to Admiral Moffett as a turncoat—a
former Moffett man now gone full out for Bull Reeves. Aside from
the impact of this conflict upon our personal fortunes, there was
the question as to what position BUAERO would take in the matter
of the relationships of squadrons to carriers. But more important
still, such a warm front of political turbulence afforded a poor
climate in which to make our big play for recognition of naval aviation
in the forthcoming fleet problem.</p>

<p>Now at the height of our concern for the future, we got a wallop
in the solar plexus that all but sent us down for the count. When
the commander in chief finally issued his own estimate of the fleet
problem and his operation orders for it, there was no reference whatever
to our proposal for a sneak attack with the <em>Saratoga</em>. The
battle wagons would do their time-honored square dance behind a
destroyer smoke screen; they would fire a few gun primers and
exercise their fire control; then they would proceed to the anchorage
and hit the beach for a big party at the Union Club. When
Frank Wagner brought the news to me and we both dropped into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the admiral’s office, he lifted his beard from his paper work to stare
at us with amazement.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is,” he boomed, “it can’t be as bad as you men look.”
After Frank had briefed him on the disappointing situation, Admiral
Reeves reached for a message blank and drafted a dispatch to
the commander in chief at San Pedro, asking for a conference for
himself and staff on the subject of the fleet problem.</p>

<p>Next morning COMAIRONS and staff took off for San Pedro
in a flight of three Loening amphibians, the admiral riding as my
passenger. As we mounted the flagship’s side ladder to her quarterdeck,
we were met at the rail by the ship’s captain, none other than
Claude C. Bloch, the man who had counseled my wife to get me out
of the side shows and back under the main tent.</p>

<p>Admiral Pratt, his blouse unbuttoned to reveal an old-fashioned
stiff-bosomed white shirt, received us in his cabin. Seated behind
the usual billiard-cloth-covered table, he inquired courteously in his
State-of-Maine accent to what he owed this visit from so distinguished
a group. To Admiral Reeves’s inquiry whether Admiral
Pratt had read our estimate of the situation for the fleet problem,
the commander in chief replied in the negative; he had left the matter
in the hands of his assistant chief of staff. His earlier rejection of our
big idea had been doubly disappointing because we respected him as
a sailorman of the old school and a man highly regarded as a strategist
and tactician. With the news that he had not known of our proposal,
our hopes began to revive.</p>

<p>Admiral Reeves swept in his outline with deft strokes: The
<em>Saratoga</em> would launch her aircraft two hours before dawn from a
point some 150 miles away from the Canal. To reach that point
where she would rendezvous with Admiral Pratt’s battleships, the
<em>Saratoga</em> would steam all night at 30 knots, accompanied only by the
<em>Omaha</em>, her plane guard. In the 10 hours of darkness between sunset
and the launching time, the <em>Saratoga</em> would cover 300 miles. This,
added to the 150-mile launching range, would put her 450 miles from
Panama the night before the attack. During the previous day she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
would have run 360 miles more, and these distances were such that
the enemy could hardly scout the possible areas of approach with
any certainty of discovering the <em>Saratoga</em>. There was an excellent
chance that we might get in undetected.</p>

<p>Admiral Pratt listened carefully and then put his finger on the one
weak spot. He feared that if we launched aircraft that far at sea and
lost even a single pilot, the reaction of public opinion at home might
be most unfavorable.</p>

<p>Admiral Reeves replied that when he had offered the same objection
I had produced the surprising record of the year’s operations.
Using the new equipment provided by BUAERO we had gone
through a full year without mechanical failure over the sea. Since
we were drilling constantly to avoid cockpit failures it was reasonable
to expect that we would have a similarly clean record off
Panama.</p>

<p>Satisfied by the logic of this, Admiral Pratt began to warm to the
whole idea. He suggested that, while it was now too late to change
the orders all ready issued, this very fact might be converted to our
advantage. The problem could be made a better exercise if we kept
the new plan a secret among ourselves while he arranged later to
spring a sudden change of orders on his fleet. He proposed to stop
the formation somewhere along the west coast of Mexico, send out
new orders by guard boat, release the <em>Saratoga</em> for her wide southerly
detour, and, incidentally, profit by the element of surprise inherent
in radio silence.</p>

<p>When COMAIRONS and his staff departed the flagship, we
walked on air.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed on schedule, maneuvering down along the Mexican
coast, with the <em>Saratoga</em> rehearsing her part with predawn take-offs
and rendezvous. At the time we had no night-flying equipment
and had done little night flying; but we had discipline, which was
better than any equipment. Then one day the fleet flag made a signal
for the fleet to stop and send boats for mail. When we opened
our orders we found that Admiral Pratt had assigned the <em>Omaha</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
to us as <em>Saratoga’s</em> plane guard, but instead of transferring the
DESRONS flag to a destroyer, had left Admiral Senn, Harold
Stark, and all the staff on board.</p>

<p>As the <em>Omaha</em>, lifting in the swell, ranged up alongside the <em>Saratoga</em>,
Admiral Senn, although Admiral Reeves’s senior, hailed the
<em>Big Sara</em> from his bridge by megaphone. “What do you want me to
do, Bull?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Now we began working our speed up to twenty knots, proceeding
in company with the <em>Omaha</em> leading the way on our epoch-making
wide southerly detour. And as the <em>Big Sara’s</em> decks trembled under
the thrust of her great screws, we on COMAIRONS’ staff began
to feel a tremor around our hearts. Looking back into the vessel’s
boiling wake we could see the churnings of white water as the vast
power of her great motors drove her forward; a portion of the
energy went into slip, but by far the largest part of it went into
effective forward thrust. In that turbulence we could visualize what
went on quite unseen in the slipstream of aviation, that remorseless
force which was driving us at such breathtaking speed.</p>

<p>From our lofty perch on the flag bridge we could count sixty-six
airplanes trembling there in the breeze that swept across the deck
straining them against their lashings and wheel chocks. Out in front
stood thirty-six Boeing fighters with air-cooled radial engines, airplanes
we had not dreamed about five years earlier when I had sat
in the anteroom off Admiral Moffett’s office in BUAERO. Behind
the fighters ranged twelve Vought Corsair scouts, conceived and
constructed by Chance Vought, who had written the prescription
for the Pratt and Whitney Wasp. Back on the fantail, their biplane
wings folded, nested eighteen Martin T4M torpedo-bomber
scouts, three-seaters built around the Pratt and Whitney Hornet,
an engine that even George Mead, who had created it, had solemnly
stated in writing was “quite impossible.”</p>

<p>As the crews milled about on deck, checking a cockpit cover
here or a lashing there, the squadron commanders supervised their
work. There was cagey old “Skinny” Wick, skipper of Fighting
One, the squadron that wore the high hat insignia on its fuselages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Commanding the other fighter squadron was brilliant Art Davis.
The celebrated Three Sea Hawks, with Art as their new leader,
comprised the first section of this command but the entire outfit
could now match the leading section in smooth squadron acrobatics.
In command of our scout-bomber squadron we had that rough and
ready old-timer, “Squash” Griffen. At the head of our heavy
bomber outfit rode the Old Man of the Sea himself, Harry Bogusch,
of whom Admiral Reeves had said, “That man is so crazy about
flying you’ll have to shoot him down to get the squadron out of the
sky.”</p>

<p>As we sped toward the equator, we speculated on our chances
of success. Frank Wagner, appreciating the intelligence of some of
the smart aviators on the <em>Lexington</em>, feared that, having trained
under us and learned our mental processes, they might diagnose
our play. If they should take their suspicions to Captain King, and
he should pass them on to the “blue” C.I.C. along with a suggestion
that he deploy the defending aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Panama
to scout for <em>Big Sara</em>, the <em>Lex</em> could intercept us during our daylight
run and strafe our planes on deck.</p>

<p>This fear the admiral discounted. While he had great respect for
Admiral King’s intelligence and counted him an ambitious leader
who had carefully schooled himself in all branches with a view to
ultimate command of the fleet in case of war, he rated King a hard
driver, one unlikely to invite initiative from his subordinates. To be
a good driver you had to know more about your job than anyone
else and be on it every minute. This tended to develop fear among
your juniors and discourage their enthusiasm for making suggestions.</p>

<p>The most important factor in a campaign, according to the
admiral, was a knowledge of the military character of one’s opponent.
One should not discount his abilities, nor should he overestimate
them. War is no exact science and not therefore subject to
rational analysis like, say, engineering. War itself is irrational and
the conduct of a battle is always a tragedy of errors. One must be
prepared to take risks but these must be intelligent risks—where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
advantage to be gained is commensurate with the hazards involved.
Fighting spirit is a major factor. One must know the weapons and
have faith in their efficacy. The admiral thought that King, for all
his tour of duty in aviation, was still a battleship man. He doubted
if King had real sympathy or enthusiasm for aviation.</p>

<p>“I recall that you used to box at the Academy,” he said, looking
at me, “and you remember the old instructor there, ‘Matchew’
Strohm—he of the cauliflower ears, the flattened nose, and the
Bowery dialect. ‘Matchew’ used to say, ‘If yer feelin’ sick to yer
stummick, remember maybe de udder guy is feelin’ a leetle sicker.
It ain’t de headwork, but de last leetle poosh, dat wins de fight!’”</p>

<p>We were now committed to action. We had perfected our technique.
From here on out, we’d play it by ear!</p>

<p>Sitting there in the admiral’s cabin, yarning around the green-baize-covered
table, I became suddenly aware of how far we had
traveled in the brief span of twenty years. Two decades earlier,
back there in Annapolis, I had been one of a couple of hundred
midshipmen facing an uncertain future. Britannia’s rule of the waves
had brought peace and prosperity to a world from which tyranny
had all but disappeared. The Navy had lapsed into innocuous desuetude,
after a brief flurry in the Spanish American War, and now
offered but little hope of early promotion. Admiral Reeves, then but
a lieutenant and an oldish one at that, had taught us “skinny”—physics,
electricity, and chemistry. Rated “white” by the midshipmen
and known for valor on the football field, he had threatened
to grow old in the service with no chance to display his talents.</p>

<p>Today he was the commander of a naval force, totally undreamed
of two years earlier, a product of his own conception and creation.
And he was discoursing to us on matters of tactics, strategy, military
policy, and leadership in terms we could not have comprehended
much earlier. I had gone to Annapolis, not for any love of the sea,
but because I had thought to save my father the expense of a college
training which, at the time, he could ill afford. And chance
had thrown me in with men like Dr. Lucke, a leader in the creation
of the American technology, Admiral Moffett, a leader who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
applied it to aviation, and Admiral Reeves, a leader who had conceived
a new philosophy for the naval air force.</p>

<p>The morning we sighted the low volcanic cones of the mysterious
Galápagos Islands, I recalled the day precisely twenty years
earlier when I had helped reconnoiter this little-known archipelago
while a midshipman in the armored cruiser <em>Colorado</em>. At the time
such a thing as a gasoline engine was quite unheard of in the fleet.
I had therefore sailed a whale boat into Post Office Bay and had
sought out the barrel in which, it was said, whalers were wont to
leave their letters for later transmission to their destination by whomever
chanced to pass that way. In order to commemorate the day
and emphasize the breathtaking progress of engines, I suggested to
the admiral that I might take off in a fighter and touch wheels ashore.
The admiral smilingly agreed but as we closed the islands, intermittent
squalls and areas of low visibility forced us to cancel the
project.</p>

<p>This unsettled weather continued until the evening before the
night run to Panama. We had run all day at 30 knots, with a section
of fighters on the take-off spot, ready to launch the moment the
weather cleared. The <em>Omaha</em> had reported running short of fuel,
giving us a new worry. Unless she could last the route at full speed,
we would have to launch without a plane guard. Cruising along from
one squall to the next, elated by the luck that had protected us
against prowling <em>Lexington</em> scouts, we suddenly broke out into
the clear in an area of unlimited ceiling and visibility. It was about
5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> when the fighters roared into the air.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_SEVENTEEN">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN<br>
Frigate Birds</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Up until this moment, everything done had been in rehearsal.
Now, with the possibility of enemy contact at any instant, the flag
bridge took on a new atmosphere of high tension. The admiral stood
out on the bridge, binoculars glued to his eyes, while the breeze
fingered his beard. Frank Wagner hovered beside him, alert for a
suggestion or command, a quizzical expression in his eyes, indicative
of his humorous reaction to stress. As we followed the tiny fighters
racing directly ahead along our course, we were startled by a quick
reversal that brought them racing back to the carrier.</p>

<p>At that time, fighters carried no radio. They zoomed across the
bow at low altitude to drop short sections of garden hose as message
holders. The fighters had sighted a destroyer dead ahead, an enemy
scout, the <em>Breck</em>, heading for us on a collision course. Even as we
read the message, we made out the ship’s mast, dead ahead. We’d
been caught.</p>

<p>The <em>Breck</em> turned to parallel our course, well out of gun range,
and seemed to be looking us over. The flag-chief quartermaster,
gazing at her through his long glass, turned to the admiral.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he remarked, “it looks funny to me. I wonder if he thinks
maybe he’s sighted the <em>Lexington</em>.” The admiral lowered his binoculars
and turned to me.</p>

<p>“Well,” he asked, “what do you want to do with her?” Now, the
lack of a plane-guard vessel for the next morning had lain heavily
on my mind. We had enough worries without risking a take-off
crack-up and a lost pilot. It must have been this that prompted my
facetious reply.</p>

<p>“Tell her to plane-guard us, sir!” I laughed.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash the admiral barked the signal to the flag-chief
quartermaster. As the bright flags fluttered in the late afternoon
light, the <em>Breck</em> answered. Then to our amazement, she turned and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
swung into position directly astern of us, four hundred yards away.
There we might have left her save that Ken Whiting, the official
umpire, felt obliged to make a ruling. And so we theoretically
opened fire on her with the after ten-inch, and theoretically sank
her. Ken signaled the <em>Breck</em> that she was now disabled without radio
to communicate our position.</p>

<p>We were just congratulating ourselves on this break and sweating
out the rest of the daylight, when the <em>Omaha</em> reported being
attacked by the cruiser <em>Detroit</em>. Her captain, Dick White, who had
once been my skipper on the destroyer tender <em>Bridgeport</em> and was
an old friend of Admiral Reeves, had doped out our intentions, and
disregarding his orders, had left his scouting station to look for us.
Even then he was broadcasting our position in plain English, instead
of code, begging the <em>Lexington</em> to come and get us.</p>

<p>Ken Whiting now ruled both cruisers out of the action. The
<em>Omaha</em>, already short of fuel, slowed down, but the <em>Detroit</em>, calmly
taking up the plane-guard station, began a play-by-play account of
<em>Big Sara’s</em> every move. Well, the fat was in the fire now; Captain
Dick knew we needed a plane guard too badly to wave him off, and
besides, he knew Bull Reeves too well to worry about any future
disciplining.</p>

<p>The tropic night fell on the Gulf of Panama, coming down suddenly
at five bells of the first dog watch. All night we steamed at
thirty knots with the stars closed in around our darkened decks. At
midnight the admiral called me to the flag bridge.</p>

<p>“All the squadron commanders have been up in a body to ask me
to launch immediately and not wait for dawn. What do you say?”
That was a poser. No doubt, sweating it out down in the ready
room, fearful that Army or Navy aircraft might catch them flat-footed
on deck during the night, they had come up with their big
idea.</p>

<p>“Sir,” I replied, finally, “we have no reason to believe that any
night fighters or bombers can be out this far. At least we haven’t
seen or heard any signs. To change a plan involves new risks, and
we have enough already.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“You’re right,” the admiral agreed. “I’ll tell them to turn in; we’ll
stick to the original plan.”</p>

<p>Standing on the flag bridge with the seas slapping against the side
and the night breeze filtering down our necks, I began to appreciate,
for the first time, the kind of courage that was being displayed by
this man. A half-dozen rivals, candidates for his job, were sitting
back, waiting for a break. It was the old Navy Game, keep your
neck in and let the other fellow take the risks. Sooner or later it pays
off—if you live long enough. Bull Reeves had never played that
game.</p>

<p>“Sir,” I began, “there’s a lot of brass hats watching us tonight.”
The admiral inclined his head to hear me above the roar of the
wind. “And,” I went on, “there’d be many a dry eye tomorrow if
you should slip.” For a while I thought he hadn’t heard.</p>

<p>“I know,” he replied slowly, “but a commander who stops to
appraise the impact of a military decision upon his personal fortunes
has no right to be entrusted with a command.”</p>

<p>After a while, dark figures began stirring among the parked airplanes,
and the blue lights winked on—flashlights screened by paper
torn from packages of absorbent cotton, loaned by the sick bay.
Still later, the staccato bark of an engine and red flashes from its
short exhaust stacks signaled all mechanics to start their engines.</p>

<p>By now the night air was cold and we shivered as we stood around
on the bridge, looking down on an expanse of exhaust flames. Ship’s
officers had taken their stations, their telephone helmets on their
heads. Pete Mitscher and Ken Whiting stood in the wings of the
bridge. The roar of engines swelled then ceased as suddenly as it
had started.</p>

<p>Without hearing the order, we knew what that meant: “Pilots,
man your planes.” The radio messenger handed me a signal blank.
It was a plain-English broadcast from the enemy cruiser <em>Detroit</em>.
Dick White was on the air, in his play-by-play account.</p>

<p>“<em>Saratoga</em> has started all aircraft engines,” it began. “What a
sight! A thousand tongues of red fire from their exhausts! I have
turned on searchlights and am firing pyrotechnics to indicate present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
position. Can’t someone stop this? It would be a pity, but we can’t
let them get away with this kind of murder.”</p>

<p>Over the bow roared Skinny Wick in the first airplane, her running
lights on. She turned toward Panama. Now they were getting
off at about ten-second intervals. They were rendezvousing on the
course to the Canal. Eighteen had joined up. Off went their lights!
They were going in darkened.</p>

<p>Now a second group had joined up and turned out its lights.
There went the torpedo planes. They were forming in two nine-plane
groups. One eighteen-plane fighter squadron would escort
each nine-plane bomber division. Now they’d all disappeared. There
came the last group, twelve in all—Griffen’s dive bombers. Now
they were all gone. The signalman handed me an intercept from
Dick White. “It’s magnificent. I’ve never seen such precision. It’s
breathtaking.” With that he signed off.</p>

<p>Each of the fighters was a potential 500-pound dive bomber and
if unopposed would dive immediately onto the locks. Afterward
he would climb back to his station and protect the heavy bombers
on their level-bombing run. Even the two-seaters were potential
dive bombers, and if unopposed would also go in to bomb. Thus we
had three detachments, timing their approaches so as to appear
over the defending observation posts simultaneously in order to
throw the defenses into confusion. After the bombers had delivered
their attacks and started back to the <em>Big Sara</em>, the fighter pilots would
remain behind to harass the Army pursuit. With their air-cooled
fighters they could sit on top of the Army liquid-cooled jobs, watch
them climb below in a futile effort to gain altitude, and finally thumb
their noses, as the enemy lost flying speed and spun out of control.</p>

<p>On the <em>Saratoga</em> we sweated out the hour-long minutes of the
approach. Radio silence was broken when Bogusch and Griffen
reported success. We sweated out their return; the run would take
all the available fuel. When they started coming aboard we were
too busy to exult. Every plane got in safely except Les Arnold’s
F3B. Les, our flag lieutenant, was right over the deck with a few
seconds to go before the “cut,” when his engine conked, out of gas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
He landed smoothly in the sea. We left him to the mercies of a convenient
enemy destroyer we had called in to act as plane guard, and
started out to sea.</p>

<p>But too late! For now we found ourselves under the guns of
the defending battleships. It seems that Admiral Pratt in our battleship
divisions had failed to come up in time to support us. The
navigator of the flagship had underestimated the strong current off
Cape Mala and the <em>Saratoga’s</em> screen was nowhere in sight. Every
phase of the complex air operation had gone off like clockwork. All
our squadrons had reached their objectives unopposed just at dawn,
and had caught the defenders on the ground. With the exception of
Les Arnold’s plane, which had now been recovered with only a
ducking for Les, we had no casualties of any kind. Only the mighty
battle wagons had missed the boat!</p>

<p>The critique that year was brief. Admiral Pratt took the floor.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he began, “you have witnessed the most brilliantly
conceived and most effectively executed naval operation in our
history. I expect to fly my flag in the <em>Saratoga</em> on our return cruise
north, partly as a badge of distinction but mostly because I want
to know what makes the aircraft squadrons tick.”</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years after the dawn attack on Panama, I met
Gen. J. B. Mitchell, USA, Retired, the officer who had then commanded
the Panama defenses. The general told me that, having gone
abroad early that morning in company with his adjutant, long before
the alarm had been sounded, he had sighted specks against the sky.</p>

<p>“Frigate birds?” his adjutant had inquired.</p>

<p>“Frigate birds, my eye!” the general had retorted. “Those are
enemy aircraft and they’ve caught us flat-footed.”</p>

<p>Our own high-rankers, while appreciating the tactical skill Bull
Reeves had shown, had entirely missed the implications of his accomplishment.
While the Army Air Service had been talking air
power, the Navy had created the first American strategic air force,
not one riveted to shore bases but one roving the high seas—on the
backs of the fleet! Yet if this revolutionary development was lost
upon most Americans, it was not lost upon our potential enemies,
the Japanese.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_EIGHTEEN">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN<br>
Another Turning</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Admiral Moffett did not miss the opportunity, afforded him by
the <em>Saratoga’s</em> performance, to press for his reappointment as Chief
of the Bureau of Aeronautics. He countered front office maneuvers
in the Navy Department through adroit handling of the political
angle at which he was past master. Someone on the Naval Affairs
Committee let the Secretary know that the admiral’s reappointment
for a third term was favored by that committee; then someone on
the Appropriations Committee inquired when his nomination might
be expected—and lo, the whole house of cards collapsed.</p>

<p>The performance of the <em>Saratoga’s</em> planes created a front-page
sensation; <cite>The New York Times</cite> handled the story exceptionally.
Hanson Baldwin, himself a Naval Academy man steeped in the
Mahan tradition, was on the scene, and went out with us on several
demonstrations arranged for fleet officers and distinguished visitors.
Charles A. Lindbergh, then at Panama in connection with Pan American
Airways’ first mail hop from Panama to Miami, spent several
days on board the <em>Saratoga</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of quartering him in the admiral’s cabin, we berthed him
down in the wardroom with the squadron pilots and passed the word
around that he should be treated like any other visiting Army file.
However, since his first act had been to request permission to take
off and land on the ship, and further, since approval of his request
might convey the impression that there was no mystery attached to
being a naval aviator—especially a carrier pilot—I was designated to
chaperon him during flight operations and diplomatically to fend
him off.</p>

<p>We were standing together on the bridge of the <em>Saratoga</em>, watching
the evolutions on deck. The very precision of the landings and
take-offs was a delight, and the smooth teamwork of the deck
crews was breathtaking, even to those who had grown up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the development. Lindbergh, enthusiastic as a kid with a toy airplane,
kept up a running fire of questions as to the whys and wherefores
of everything. He was particularly curious about the air tactics,
and kept Wagner and the admiral busy answering searching questions.
Lindbergh’s eyes gleamed and his boyish grin widened as the
admiral held forth as only he could do.</p>

<p>It was after the operations had been concluded and we were
heading back to port that Lindbergh popped the question that was
uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>“Why won’t you let me land on board?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Admiral Wiley is reluctant to accept responsibility for your
safety,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I’m responsible for myself,” he retorted brusquely. “Isn’t it a
fact that they just don’t want an Army officer around a carrier?”
he added.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I replied. And then I moved on to the counterplan.
“You remember the Three Sea Hawks at the Los Angeles air races
last year?” I inquired.</p>

<p>Naturally Lindbergh remembered.</p>

<p>“Well,” I went on, “Tommy Tomlinson has left the service, but
Put Storrs and Bill Davis are here, and the boys thought you might
like to lead them in a Section take-off, and fly ashore with them
when you go.”</p>

<p>Lindbergh nodded. “I’d like that,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“It would make a good story,” I went on. “‘Leader of Three
Musketeers takes off with Three Sea Hawks.’” Lindbergh shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Not interested in the publicity,” he said.</p>

<p>And there, thought I, was a key to his conduct. Lindbergh was so
honest, intellectually and in every other way, that the antics of
publicity seekers revolted him. Newspaper men, having never before
encountered a celebrity who was not avid for publicity, could
not be expected to understand this. They made—and broke—celebrities
at will. They considered that they had made Lindbergh and
most now thought him ungrateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>With Admiral Moffett’s reappointment to the Bureau, we became
curious as to Admiral Reeves’s new assignment. He had made it
a practice never to request duty for himself, and now rather hoped
he might get command of the Ninth Naval District, at Great Lakes.
But when the news leaked out through the grapevine, it was a dive-bomb
hit right amidships. Admiral Reeves was to go to the Navy
Yard at Mare Island as Inspector, a job that usually rated a commander
or, at most, a captain. The admiral took the news cheerfully
as usual.</p>

<p>However, this was but a preliminary “strafing attack,” the name
the admiral had coined for diving tactics. One day Wagner walked
into the admiral’s cabin, his face as long as the <em>Saratoga’s</em> flight deck.
Waving a letter in his hand he sank down in his seat at the mess
table and announced, with a wry grin, “They’re shanghaiing me to
Guam!” At first we thought he was simply using the slang phrase,
but it turned out to be literally true.</p>

<p>“And as for you,” he added, nodding to me with a sudden grin
that always signaled the triumph of his humor, “you’re headed for
Coco Solo.”</p>

<p>Coco Solo, the big new base on the Atlantic side of the Canal,
would have been most acceptable as a command following a full
three years’ sea cruise, but I had been but a year afloat and was
already on the short side of sea duty. The assignment, had it been
carried out, would have been a sentence to oblivion. Admiral Reeves
later saw that it wasn’t. For when the new Commander in Chief,
Battle Fleet, who relieved Admiral Pratt, proved to be Adm. Louis
M. Nulton, a friend of Admiral Reeves, the latter promptly dispatched
a letter to Admiral Nulton suggesting that he ask for me
as his Aide for Aviation on the Battle Fleet Staff. This assignment
put me one notch above the Aircraft Squadrons, whose new commander
was announced as Admiral Butler, with Ken Whiting in
my job as Chief of Staff. And since Admiral Nulton was known as
a man for detail, the Aircraft Squadrons Staff saw that they would
need a friend on high if they were to retain the freedom of action
Admiral Pratt had always given Admiral Reeves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was a gloomy outfit that received Admiral Pratt on
the <em>Big Sara</em> for the cruise home. The admiral had just been selected
for the highest naval command, Chief of Naval Operations, in Washington.
En route north he brought up the problem of the “home
yard” for the <em>Lexington</em>. Norfolk was the <em>Lexington’s</em> home yard.
Admiral Pratt, proposed to return her to the Atlantic in order to
balance the work load—in other words keep the yard workmen
employed.</p>

<p>Wagner and I took issue with him and I must have pressed too
hard on the need for keeping the squadrons together for training, for
Admiral Pratt turned on me in some annoyance and barked, “You
always see the ultimate objective and want to take it on the first
assault. You’ve got to learn to take minor objectives one at a time,
and to hold them till the big one falls in your lap. Otherwise,” he
added, shaking a finger in my face, “you’ll never get anywhere in this
man’s Navy.”</p>

<p>Shortly after we arrived in San Diego, and even before the
admiral’s relief had reported, Bull Reeves was detached from his
command. The day he shoved off, all his squadron commanders and
staff accompanied him to the Santa Fe railway station. Overhead
FLEET AIR paraded for him in a last formation flight. The Old
Man put up a cheerful front until Harry Bogusch shook his hand.</p>

<p>“Admiral,” said Harry, “we used to hate your guts for making
us fly those tight formations, but that night off Panama we blessed
you for the air discipline you had forced on us.” With that, two
big tears welled up in Bull Reeves’s eyes and ran down his nose onto
his gray whiskers.</p>

<p>After Admiral Nulton had hoisted his flag on the fleet flagship
<em>California</em>, I found myself once again on a battleship. Time
was when I would have thrilled at the thought. Now it left me numb.
To have served with two great leaders in succession and to have lived
through the creative period of naval aviation ashore and afloat and
then go back to battle wagons cheerfully was too much to expect.
I couldn’t get into the spirit of it.</p>

<p>When later the <em>California</em> spent the summer at the navy yard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
in Bremerton, Washington, I was completely cut off from aircraft
operations except by correspondence. Admiral Nulton and his battle
fleet staff tried hard to absorb some of the new ideas, but it was
too much to expect them to think and act intuitively, along lines
that crisscrossed every preconceived idea.</p>

<p>The end of the summer found us back behind the breakwater
at San Pedro, when one day a message came that Fred Rentschler
and Bill Boeing had flown down from Seattle in their Ford Trimotor
and were at the Los Angeles Biltmore where they would like me
to have dinner with them. I knew from the newspapers and from
letters that great things had been going on in the aircraft industry.
Not only had some of the companies made money on operations,
but some of the leaders had become rich as a result of the increased
values of their stocks. This was the beginning of the end of that
mad period of speculation in which all sorts of mergers and consolidations
had prompted the public to get into the market and make
a killing. In the aircraft industry, Curtiss and Wright had led off
with a merger that had brought together two of the greatest names
in aviation and had put two of the biggest operations under the
same tent.</p>

<p>In reply Boeing, Rentschler, Chance Vought, and others, fearing
the giant thus created, had consolidated in a merger of their own. Unlike
the Curtiss-Wright consolidation, which, to them, smacked of
Wall Street, the new one was to comprise only sound companies,
those which had already proved profitable or seemed likely to continue
to do so. The big idea was to bring together, under one leadership,
the best in airplanes, engines, propellers, and transport systems
in order to coordinate engineering experience in a way that would
speed progress. For passenger air transport still seemed to hang on
a dead center: it was impossible to reduce rates unless volume could
be stepped up, and volume refused to step up until costs came down.</p>

<p>The new outfit, which had taken the name of the United Aircraft
and Transport Corporation, planned to get its engineering heads together
and create improved aircraft designed to break that log jam.
Fred Rentschler and Bill Boeing had come to Los Angeles to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
over some of the western companies like Northrup, which had already
joined up, and Menasco, which would like to. Reading about
the Curtiss-Wright consolidation, I had to smile at the idea I had
once had of depending upon those two for air-cooled engine competition.
Save for Fred Rentschler and Pratt and Whitney, they
would now have us by the neck.</p>

<p>It was an interesting circumstance that the particular group should
have joined up in the new outfit. For I had put the bee on Chance
Vought that had produced the prescription for the Pratt and Whitney
Wasp, and had later sent Bill Boeing to Fred Rentschler for the
engines for his mail planes, the very engines that had made possible
a tidy profit out of a venture that Bill’s competition had called impossible.
And save for the Martin torpedo bombers, this group had
supplied all the equipment for our carriers, including the engines
for the Martins. And the marriage seemed natural from another point
of view: the parties at interest were all pioneers with a zeal for aviation
and they had all played the game according to Hoyle.</p>

<p>On arrival at the Biltmore I found another old-timer in their
company. Thomas Hamilton, like Bill Boeing, had grown up in
Seattle, but unlike Bill Boeing he had not had money to spend on
airplanes. Instead he had taught himself to fly in a crate of his own
construction and had then built his own business. On the outbreak
of World War I, Tom had rushed to Washington to get a contract
to build airplanes but had been diverted to Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
the home of furniture manufacture, to make propellers. He had,
however, established his own Metalplane Company and built a high-wing
metal monoplane that, he claimed, antedated the Ford. And
when the new United Aircraft and Transport Corporation had
looked around for a propeller company to round out their line, they
had taken over Tom Hamilton, his Hamilton Aero Manufacturing
Company, and his Hamilton Metalplane Company. Tom, like every
other Tom, Dick, and Harry of that time, had been in the stock
market but, unlike some of them, had done well.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening, I noted the changes that had come over
these men. The time had been when they had scratched gravel for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the last trace of “color” that might lie close to bedrock. Now they
flew high, wide, and handsome on the crest of the current boom.
They had flown in aboard their own Ford Trimotor; they had taken
a suite at the Biltmore and now they ordered the exotic foods on the
menu. One advantage of the naval service was that much of this had
passed us by; we had security, but no wealth. These men had wealth
but little security, and even at the height of the great boom of the
late ’twenties, Fred Rentschler, at least, clearly foresaw the ultimate
outcome. To him the whole thing was crazy—a house of cards built
on a foundation of sand, foredoomed to collapse at the first real
tremor. Meanwhile they shop-talked back and forth, discussing their
current management problems, one of which seemed to concern
Tom Hamilton and his propeller company.</p>

<p>It seemed that after I had taken the decision, away back there in
BUAERO, that we would use the new metal propellers in place of
the wooden ones, two companies had competed for the business—the
Hamilton Aero Manufacturing Company, of Milwaukee, and
the Standard Steel Propeller Company, of Pittsburgh. In the middle
had sat the Reed Propeller Company, owners of the patents taken
out by Dr. Sylvanus Reed. These patents, covering metal propeller
blades made of “light alloys, solid throughout the outer half of their
length,” had been discounted by both Hamilton Aero and Standard
Steel, who had declared them invalid. However, the new Curtiss-Wright
Corporation had absorbed the Reed Company to put the
power of Curtiss-Wright dollars behind the patents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tom Hamilton, of Hamilton Aero, and Harry Kraeling,
of Standard Steel, fought their conflict on other grounds. To
match Tom Hamilton’s propeller-design savvy, Harry Kraeling
hired Frank Caldwell, the Army’s civilian propeller expert, away
from the Army. Frank Caldwell had a few inventions himself and
was one of the best informed men in the industry. Both companies
sold “two-piece” propellers—that is, duralumin blades mounted in
steel hubs that permitted blade-angle adjustment on the ground.
The Reed Company held to single-piece, fixed-pitch props made
of solid duralumin. It was one of these that had dumped me into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
dirt at Anacostia, back in 1926, when a blade had broken off close
to the hub. I still kept a section of that blade as a souvenir. Now after
United Aircraft and Transport Corporation had acquired Hamilton
Aero, of Milwaukee, Standard Steel, of Pittsburgh, had countered
by recognizing the Reed patents and taking a license from Curtiss-Wright.
Standard paid Curtiss royalties, and in exchange Curtiss
agreed to sue all infringers of the patents—including Hamilton.</p>

<p>Fred Rentschler, as president of United, had not relished a patent
suit with Curtiss and had therefore bought up Standard Steel of
Pittsburgh from its local stockholders. This had given him freedom
from the threat of suit because he had acquired the license in the
transaction, but it had opened up other problems. The two propeller
companies had been so highly competitive, it now seemed unlikely
that either Hamilton or Kraeling could consolidate the two outfits
into a single company; they needed new and neutral management.
Furthermore, since the consolidation had brought the two manufacturers
into one group, the action had deprived the Army and
Navy of their cherished competitive sources and had substituted instead
a potential monopoly.</p>

<p>It was like old times to chin with these friends about their business
problems and to become, for an evening at least, a part of the
world I had once lived in. In that world, petty personal jealousies
had to be subordinated to business principles. Only in a semipolitical
organization, such as the Army or Navy, where there was no financial
statement to measure the quality of leadership, could men indulge
in such extravagances as personal politics. Of course in business,
personalities did exercise strong influences, but in the long run,
economics seemed to write the answer to the business equation.</p>

<p>After a visit in Los Angeles, Rentschler and Bill Boeing flew to
San Diego to call on the Navy. Taking off in my little Vought
Corsair, I went ahead to introduce them to the new command down
there. Then one evening as we sat together in a bedroom of the old
Hotel del Coronado, that relic of the lush boom days of Southern
California, Tom Hamilton and Bill Boeing turned in, leaving Fred
and me to talk shop. Fred was back on his propeller problem, wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
if I, by any chance, could suggest a possible new president for
the consolidated company. He had, of course, kept in touch with
the gossip in BUAERO over the controversy with FLEET AIR,
and was aware of its influence on my personal situation. The talk
drifted naturally to this subject, and before I was aware of its drift,
Fred had invited me to take over the propeller job.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” I laughed. “At forty-two, I’d be crazy to even
consider it. In the first place I am devoted to the service and, in the
second, there’s nothing in a naval officer’s training to qualify him
for business competition.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t suggested it,” Fred replied soberly, “without first thinking
the matter through. I’m sure you have the necessary versatility
and resourcefulness.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your interest and thank you for the compliment,”
I replied, “but frankly I’m sorry you brought it up. If I accepted,
which, of course I have no intention of doing, the time would surely
come when I would regret it. And in passing it up, I open myself
to the certainty that every future setback will make me sorry I lacked
the guts to resign.”</p>

<p>“Is there no way for you to retire?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, and if there were, that wouldn’t be the way to go about it.
Nothing but a complete separation would do, and for me, that is
quite out of the question. I’ve got twenty-five years in on my retirement.
Throwing that away would be stupid.”</p>

<p>“Well, think it over,” he persisted. “And when you’re ready,
let me know. You could start with the propeller company, and then,
if things work out, you could go on from there.” I laughed at the
idea.</p>

<p>And, at the moment, I was serious about it, but after Fred and
Bill and Tom had left, I found I couldn’t turn off his voice by a flick
of the switch. This was no ordinary proposal to be dismissed forthwith:
These men had shown me their stuff on many occasions.
They were deep in the technical development of aviation, something
close to my own heart. They were getting big things done; I
was bogged down in a maze of politics with no clear objective before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
me, and frustrations wearing me down. I began lying awake nights,
analyzing the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Trying to compare advantages and disadvantages like this got
me nowhere. The fundamental fact was that if I persisted in working
at aviation I must risk my chance for high command. If, however,
I gave up aviation and returned to line duty, I would be deserting
technical development at the very time it needed the attention of
everyone who had acquired experience in it. In private business I
could continue the engineering development and, far from impairing
my future as an executive, could actually enhance it. For in the
new era which had blossomed in the brief fifteen years since Dr.
Charles Edward Lucke and Columbia University, an executive
with a fundamental engineering training had a better chance to
accomplish things in a manufacturing business than one without such
training.</p>

<p>The chances of a former naval officer succeeding in business
were slim, but the chance was there. The risk of failure was great,
but the opportunity to contribute importantly to the advance of
aviation was enough to warrant taking the chance. Admiral Reeves
would have judged it “an intelligent risk.” I submitted my resignation,
and received the acceptance in December, 1929.</p>

<p>The stock market had crashed two months before; the world
had entered a protracted period of depression. I had bought a
complete outfit of brand new uniforms, for duty on the commander
in chief’s staff. Now I packed them away in a sea chest, along with
the prize sword “awarded by the Class of 1871 for proficiency in
ordnance and gunnery,” and turned my back on the sea. After
twenty-five years of naval service, I signed off for life.</p>

<p>Throughout this tortured period of indecision, my wife had taken
no other position than the traditional one of the Navy wife, “Whither
thou goest!” She had listened with her usual patience to my reasoning,
but reserved to herself the intuitive process that proved in the
end to be right. For it was only after we had been out of the service
some time that I learned a fact that would have made the decision
far easier, one that she had sensed all along. In civil life we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
free. No longer were we social and professional slaves to every
officer and his wife who happened, by accident of date of appointment
or scholastic standing at Annapolis, to outrank us on the precedence
list. But one basic fact was clear; the slipstream that had sucked
me into naval aviation had now blasted me out of the service I had
loved, and into civil life.</p>

Necessity, the Mother of Creation</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">When, shortly after the first of January, 1930, Tom Hamilton
took me up to Milwaukee to look over the Hamilton Aero plant
there, the stock market crash had already enveloped the country
in a cold chill. Along the Northwestern Railway’s right of way,
cold smoke stacks pointed dead fingers toward leaden skies and
fear gripped the land. However, we found Tom’s modern factory
still bright and cheerful for it had been well equipped and was now
well run by Arvid Nelson, its manager. While the civilian demand
for propellers had collapsed with the boom, military business had
continued firm under the five-year Army and Navy building programs.</p>

<p>It was when we went down to Pittsburgh to look over Standard
Steel that I got a jolt. The plant, located across the river in Homestead
in a former cap-pistol factory, was as drab and cheerless as
Pittsburgh itself. With many of the steel mills down as a result of
the market collapse, there was less smog than usual along the Monongahela,
but the grime of the past still clung to treeless slopes.
After a look over the situation there it was clear we must cut the
consolidated propeller company back to a size suited to the reduced
demand.</p>

<p>While the plant in Milwaukee appeared the better of the two,
the State of Wisconsin had a heavy corporation income tax that
would have to be included in costs; and besides, Milwaukee lay
off the main east-west line of rail communication. At Pittsburgh,
Harry Kraeling had just completed a new three-story loft building
in which we might concentrate the machinery of both companies,
and the plant had a siding to the main line of the Pennsylvania.
Here, about halfway between Washington, D.C., and Dayton, Ohio,
was a situation that offered such advantages that we decided to
consolidate the best equipment and the most skilled workmen there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
We would then abandon all excess facilities and endeavor to set
up a plant with a break-even point calculated to keep us in the black
even with the greatly reduced military production level.</p>

<p>In calculating this setup, I had help from the head office in New
York and in the person of Joseph F. McCarthy, controller of United
Aircraft. Mac, I found, was the sort of wizard who could glance at
columns of figures and read in them signs and portents such as
could be made clear to me only after I had reduced them to engineer’s
language of graphs and charts. From him I discovered that a financial
statement is not just the cold record of past mistakes or triumphs,
but also a weather map from which to forecast future trends and to
take decisions calculated to reap the abundant harvest.</p>

<p>Using the figures available, we calculated the size of the facility
with which we might expect to continue to break even during a
period of slow demand but still retain the flexibility essential to reaping
a profit when the tide turned. United Aircraft was frankly not
in business for its health; it was in business for a fair profit and each
of the subsidiaries was expected to stand on its own two feet. By
consolidating the financial resources of all its subsidiaries in the
parent company, it had in effect broadened the resources of each.
Any company in temporary need of funds might look to the parent
company without going outside to borrow, but over the long pull it
must contribute its share to the over-all income.</p>

<p>Having had no training whatever in accounting or finance, but
having been schooled by Dr. Lucke to search for fundamental principles,
I now began digging down to bedrock and in J. F. McCarthy,
himself, discovered a rich nugget. Profit, it seemed, was not just
the excess of receipts over expenditures, a sum to be divided among
a few insiders and squandered in riotous living. Profit was, among
other things, the great regulator and controller of trade, and trade
was the foundation of human existence. Under the free play of
natural competitive forces, the compelling need to make a profit
or go out of business and starve was what drove men to cut costs of
production. If they could reduce costs enough to make the product
available to more people they could increase the demand and expand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the volume of production. Out of their profits, or the anticipation
of profits, they could attract new money with which to buy
new machinery designed to cut costs further and expand volume
further. All this was a delicate, living process that required good
judgment and great skill to nurture.</p>

<p>Profit, it appeared, was like the governor on a steam generator.
Increased demand for power would slow down the engine and
reduce the voltage were it not for the fact that the governor, sensitive
to small changes in speed, now opened the throttle wider to admit
the extra steam required to meet the new demand. Contrariwise,
when the demand fell off the engine might overspeed and destroy
itself, save that the eversensitive governor now reacted quickly to
close the throttle, and save the machine.</p>

<p>Profit was therefore no devouring ogre, as some would have us
believe, nor was it just the regulator or controller of costs. Men,
in seeking to make a profit—and correspondingly to avoid a loss—were
ever on the alert to create new devices and new products. If
one of these turned out to be useful, or desirable, and if its price
proved reasonable, then the device would come into general use and
its production and use would become profitable for both its creator
and its user, to say nothing of the workmen who manufactured it.
If, however, the device or idea failed to measure up to the customer’s
expectations, or failed to satisfy his tastes, then it would just fade
out; nature, it appeared, was highly selective. She believed in enterprise.</p>

<p>When natural law was permitted to function according to principle,
corrective forces maintained a degree of equilibrium. To each
action there was an opposite and equal reaction and the action contained
the germ of the reaction, to the end that the pendulum could
not swing too far. It was only when man-made law began hampering
natural law that the violent swings took place. No man could
understand the workings of the natural law well enough to anticipate
the future nor, were he able to do so, could he control the future.
Least of all did he have wisdom enough to incorporate the germ
of a corrective action in his plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>As I studied this matter of profit and business cycles, I began to
get hold of a truth that seemed to be the answer to a lot of questions
about the place of the machine in the economy. Men were beginning
to argue that labor-saving machinery would bring about technological
unemployment, and as the world-wide depression deepened, the
facts seemed to confirm the opinion. However, there was another
side to this coin: in a technological age when some engineers were
engrossed with the task of cutting costs with machinery, other
engineers were busy creating new devices to sell. And when these
new devices clicked, they called for the creation of new enterprises,
the employment of new money—even the creation of new wealth—and
best of all the creation of new jobs for workmen. The automotive
industry was one of many brilliant examples of this fact.</p>

<p>Now no man or group of men could possibly have enough wisdom
to control the operations of this law. The free play of natural forces
was the only intelligent controller. Like the slipstream of an airplane,
this process might appear to be turbulent and wasteful, but again,
like the slipstream, it was one of the most efficient processes in nature.
The best men could do was try to maintain a healthy climate in
which the process could flourish, and since the key lay in the incentive
for the human spirit, men’s chief contribution must come
out of faith in the natural process.</p>

<p>All this was a revelation to me in more ways than one. Like most
naval officers I had absorbed something of the point of view of the
professional man who tends to look down his nose at the tradesman.
Overimpressed by the sins of a few profiteers, we considered
businessmen mere money grubbers inclined to wink at sharp practices,
if not downright dishonesty. To the professional man, especially
one in public service, whose compensation does not clearly
reflect the results of his own efforts, the real reward lies in his
knowledge of a job well done. To some, this provides all the incentive
required, but to most it furnishes an excuse to sit on the beach
and watch the ebb and flow of the tides. The military man is prone
to forget that some hard worker must create the wealth necessary
to support him in the honorable estate to which he has become accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
and that if comparable salaries make his appear modest,
Uncle Sam is lavish with the perquisites.</p>

<p>When I sought to probe these matters with J. F. McCarthy, I
found a kindred spirit. From the inception of the company, Fred
Rentschler had brought Mac into every business discussion and
decision; it had been his idea that finance should walk hand in hand
with operations rather than bring up the rear with a truck load of
old ledgers. He had, therefore, given Mac a high degree of autonomy
in financial matters especially in the subsidiaries and Mac had used
this so skillfully that everyone in the organization respected his
business judgment and admired his integrity.</p>

<p>As time passed, and my responsibilities in United widened, Mac
and I expanded our viewpoints together. Shortly after completing
the physical consolidation at Pittsburgh, I was made president of
the Sikorsky company at Bridgeport. A year later, after Chance
Vought had died suddenly, I became head of his company in East
Hartford. In less than a year, I, the least experienced businessman in
United had fallen heir to its three problem children. As the depression
deepened, and vast social changes began to take place, I sensed
the far-reaching responsibilities that attach to the head of a manufacturing
organization. Aside from the normal headaches incident
to managing a competitive enterprise during a period of world-wide
depression, there were heavy responsibilities imposed by strange
forces unleashed by politicians prying open Pandora’s Box. This
was an era when American business was placed on trial for its very
life.</p>

<p>Our difficulty at Pittsburgh sprang primarily from the fact that
the consolidation of the two manufacturers of metal propellers had
created a potential monopoly; and there is no business more vulnerable
than a monopoly. Our two steady customers, the Army and
the Navy, wasted no time in slapping us down; they turned their
propeller business over to fly-by-night competitors, and worse still,
to government arsenals. My first venture in business was now threatened
by unfair competition from sources that contributed nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
to engineering and development and charged their overhead to a
government appropriation.</p>

<p>It was somewhat as if Uncle Sam had pirated a manuscript of a
best seller and had had it printed in the Government Printing Office
or a sweat shop at public expense, and then left the author to starve.
The policy is hardly designed to advance the writing art and, in
the long run, is sure to prove bad medicine for the government,
that is the people, itself.</p>

<p>This fact we endeavored to point out to both Army and Navy,
urging that it was to their interest that we continue to live. After all,
we were the only organization in the world capable of continuing
the development of metal propellers; foreign aircraft still clung to
their archaic wooden props, and foreigners were still convinced of
their superiority. We tried to point out that the consolidation had
been forced by patent considerations and for no other reason, that the
new management had been drawn from Army and Navy and had no
intention of monopolizing anything but was determined to foster
progress in new design. Their reply was to ask to see the color of our
new designs.</p>

<p>With survival dependent upon the creation of something new
and better, I went upstairs to the engineering department to put the
problem before its chief, Frank Caldwell. Frank, a big cinnamon
bear of a fellow with a slow Tennessee drawl, had forgotten more
about aircraft propellers than most engineers would ever know.
While Chief of the Army Propeller Branch at Dayton, he had suggested
to Harry Kraeling, then a salesman of the steel alloy
Vanadium, that he give up trying to build propeller blades out of
welded-steel sheets, and use instead the new aluminum alloy, duralumin.
When I put the problem up to Frank, he hoisted his bulk out
of his chair and ambled toward a drawing table in the corner of his
office. Pushing aside a T square, he peeled the cover back from a
large drawing and looked at the black lines with modest pride.</p>

<p>At that time, the Hamilton-Standard duralumin blades were
clamped into the sockets of steel hubs in such a way that when an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
airplane stood on the ground, the blades might be adjusted to whatever
setting was desired. However, once set, the blades were not
adjustable in the air. This gave the airplane a handicap such as a
motor car would have if deprived of its gearshift. The propeller
shown in Frank’s drawing, however, had a mechanism for adjusting
the propeller blade setting in the air. The pilot might use one setting,
corresponding to low gear, when taking off, and another corresponding
to high, for cruising. Frank visualized his “controllable pitch
propeller” as the “gearshift of the air.”</p>

<p>The idea of such a propeller was not new. Many people had
tried the device and found it sound in conception; the problem was
that no one had been able to build one of the things strong enough
to stand up under the extremely high centrifugal and vibratory
stresses found in propeller blades. The novelty of Frank’s design lay
in its simple hydraulic control mechanism, in which oil pressure on a
piston rotated the blades and locked them in either of two positions,
the best setting for cruising or for take-off. Judged by the old
engineering adage, “to be good it must look good,” Frank’s propeller
looked to me like the answer to a maiden’s prayer.</p>

<p>Now Frank Caldwell was no overenthusiastic salesman. The best
he would say for his brain child was to express the quiet hope that
it might amount to something some day—provided we could make
it hang together. But to me there was no use fooling around; here
was just the kind of gadget we needed to pull us out of the hole.
I gave orders to shoot the works and rush the development of the
“gearshift of the air.”</p>

<p>Fifteen years later, after we had become more conscious of the
need for corporate social security and after we had got ourselves
all bound up in our own red tape, I doubt if United Aircraft would
ever have undertaken such a project.</p>

<p>For the problem was not so simple as I have so far stated it. The
new propeller must of necessity prove more costly than the old
type, and there was no proof that the increase in performance
would justify the increased costs. This question did not lend itself to
precise calculation, nor could we solve it by trying the propeller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
on an existing airplane. In order to realize the advantages of the
new type we must build a new airplane designed to exploit it, and
in those days people just didn’t haul off and build airplanes to sell
other people’s propellers.</p>

<p>The point is that at the moment the controllable-pitch propeller,
one day to be recognized as the most revolutionary device in aeronautics,
was not then something that men demanded. In fact, current
opinion was bearish on the idea just as it had been on the air-cooled
engine and still was on reduction gears. In the judgment of the
wise men, such devices were bound to be so heavy or so costly
that their advantages might at best balance out their disadvantages,
so why bother with the complication? Frank Caldwell had thought
it through, but, being modest and conservative, he did not try to sell
the device to me. My own reaction was intuitive rather than rational.</p>

<p>Though I reported my decision to Fred Rentschler at the New
York office, he naturally took little notice of it until our financial
statement began showing red ink. Lacking profitable production to
support an expensive development, we had begun to show serious
losses. Since there was no flight experience available to support my
venture, Fred was all for canceling the project to avoid further
losses. The sole argument I could bring to bear was the fact that I
had installed an experimental prop equipped with magnesium blades
in one of the small Sikorsky amphibians, an S-39, which had astonished
me with its quick take-off and improved cruising characteristics.
Behind my decision, however, had lain the whole background
of aviation development. One device after another had been proposed
and rejected on the basis of engineering judgment, only to be
later perfected by some zealot who refused to recognize handicaps.
I expressed confidence in the outcome and offered to gamble my
job on it. Fred shook his head in doubt.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said sourly, “it had better pan out or it will be just
too bad for you.”</p>

<p>Now there remained one process by which I might recover some
of our investment. The propeller had been developed to the point
where we might offer a few of them to the Army and Navy at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
experimental prices on experimental contracts, a practice long used
to foster new and expensive developments. But when I went down
to BUAERO I ran into a cold front that iced me up like nothing I
had ever before seen. The Plans Division of BUAERO seemed now
to have usurped the functions of the Engine Section in developments
of this kind, and the head of that division was now Comdr.
Richmond Kelly Turner, USN, a Naval Academy classmate of
mine and a friend of long standing. “Spuds” Turner was a tough
egg, something the Japs were to learn at Tarawa and other South
Pacific actions some fifteen years later; I didn’t have to wait that
long.</p>

<p>Kelly Turner seemed to think that controllable-pitch propellers
were no good in general, and to suspect that the one I was trying to
sell was probably the least useful of them all. If I had wasted my
company’s money chasing a will-o’-the-wisp, he had no intention
of sending any of Uncle Sam’s hard earned cash on a wild-goose
chase to try to bail me out of my business mistakes. “Spuds” did not
confine his opinions to me in a confidential chat, but took pains to
broadcast them all through the corridors of BUAERO in a loud
stentorian voice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after taking over the Sikorsky job, I had felt the
need of a new assistant in Hamilton-Standard and had learned
through George Wheat, our public relations counsel, that Raycroft
Walsh, a former major in the Air Corps who had resigned to
go into business, might be interested. Ray had had an active Army
career and, during the Mitchell controversy, had served in the
Office of the Chief of Air Corps, Maj. Gen. Mason M. Patrick, as
Finance Officer where he had performed some of the functions I
had performed for Admiral Moffett. I liked him the moment I
met him, and immediately recommended that he be brought into
the company.</p>

<p>When Ray took the new propeller to the Army, he encountered
a similar lack of interest. Even though he carried his case to the
Assistant Secretary of War for Air, Mr. F. Trubee Davison, and
finally to his friend Pat Hurley, Secretary of War, stressing the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
that refusal to help develop the new propeller would prove disastrous
to the Army and fatal to Hamilton-Standard, he made no more
progress than had I with my friend “Spuds” Turner. It was a kind
providence which, taking us by the hand, led us out to Cheyenne,
Wyoming, and a new milepost in history.</p>

<p>For prior to the crisis in the affairs of Hamilton-Standard, United
Aircraft and Transport Corporation, having in mind the need for
building new transport aircraft designed to carry passengers and
mail on a profitable basis, had initiated a joint airplane development
headed up by Boeing. Based upon the performance of the Boeing
“Monomail,” a single-engined low-wing monoplane itself partly
derived from the earlier work of Jack Northrup, Boeing had taken in
hand its new ten-passenger, twin-engined, low-wing monoplane to
be called the “Boeing 247.” Designed around a new Pratt and Whitney
Wasp engine and equipped with Hamilton-Standard propellers,
it was intended as a replacement for all other assorted models in
use on the line. Boeing, confident of its engineering ability, had
released for production a full order of some sixty airplanes without
first testing out a prototype. This procedure, if successful, would
put the airplane company far ahead of any competitor and would
give the transport company a big jump on other airlines such as
it had earned by creating the earlier model, 40-B.</p>

<p>At first everything had gone swimmingly, but the day the first
ship to fly over the lines essayed to take off with full load from the
high-altitude field at Cheyenne, serious trouble developed; the airplane
just could not handle full load satisfactorily from such elevations.
At first, Boeing had been inclined to blame Pratt and Whitney
and the Wasp engine for insufficient horsepower, but when that
attempt failed, both parties shifted the blame onto Hamilton-Standard
propellers, claiming faulty propeller design. This was the old
Indian game of passing the buck around the eternal triangle of
engine, propeller, and airplane. When we sent Frank Caldwell to
Cheyenne to investigate he went quietly about a demonstration that,
we hoped, would prove convincing.</p>

<p>First he adjusted the duralumin blades at best setting for take-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
to show how well the ship would perform even at high altitude. This
setting, however, was so inefficient at cruising speeds that the nearby
mountain peaks echoed and reechoed the whining complaint of
whirring blades. To meet this defect, Frank reset the blades to the
best angle for cruising, where the airplane, its load having been reduced
for take-off, performed perfectly. After this convincing
demonstration, he unwrapped his drawings of a controllable-pitch
propeller for the 247. While no such prop had yet been air-tested,
Boeing brushed the objection aside, confident now that between the
two companies, the airplane could be salvaged.</p>

<p>So it was that Frank Caldwell’s controllable-pitch propeller not
only saved the whole string of Boeing 247’s, but in doing so, it
opened up the new era of “three-mile-a-minute” air passenger travel
and started air transport on its way. After that, even the Army and
Navy began to recognize the potentialities of the new propeller;
it paved the way for low-wing monoplanes with their high-wing
loadings and thus marked the passing of the biplanes.</p>

<p>But prior to the Cheyenne demonstration, Hamilton-Standard
propellers dragged bottom. Ray Walsh, who had taken over its
management, closed the Pittsburgh plant, reduced the organization
to a handful of the ablest men, and moved the shop into a corner
of Pratt and Whitney’s ample building in East Hartford. Later,
when success acclaimed the genius of Frank Caldwell, Ray began
expanding his organization to meet new demands and finally built
an additional wing on the Pratt and Whitney building to house his
new shop. Still later, we moved Chance Vought Aircraft down to
Stratford to bunk in with a much deflated Sikorsky, and turned
the whole Vought shop over to Hamilton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when Ray undertook to sell the rights to manufacture
the new propellers in England, he encountered problems both at
home and abroad. The British Air Ministry, like our own services,
discounted the propeller—this was a time when most Britishers discounted
everything American—and our own armed forces threatened
to refuse us the right to license them under our patents. Since
our government had contributed precisely nothing to the development,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and especially since my classmate, Kelly Turner, had broadcast
his decision to the whole aeronautic establishment, they were hardly
in position to claim much equity or any right to control a device
of such obvious interest to commercial air transport.</p>

<p>However, it was in a totally different role that the Hamilton-Standard
controllable-pitch propeller attained immortality. The
manager of the propeller branch of the de Havilland Aircraft Company,
Ltd., our English licensees, was John Parkes, himself a fighter
pilot, an Englishmen who retained some of the ancient enterprise
and love of innovation. Today he is managing director of Alvis
Limited, Coventry, but then he was the moving spirit in the adaptation
of the Hamilton-Standard propeller to the British Spitfire
fighters, the planes that helped win the Battle of Britain. The Germans
had developed their own controllable-pitch propellers and,
save for the curious chain of circumstances outlined here, would
have hopelessly outclassed the British. When Mr. Churchill paid
tribute to the “so few” to whom Britain owed so much, he probably
had in mind the courageous fighter pilots but behind them stood,
among others, Ray Walsh, Frank Caldwell, and John Parkes.</p>

<p>And so we trace the living process through which our struggle
to survive created new devices and exercised profound influences
that no human mind could have imagined. The miscalculation of one
engineer saved the creation of another engineer just in time to give
air transport the necessary fillip, and to provide British fighters with
the winning punch. And there is a final point to keep in mind: it
was the performance of Hamilton-Standard’s controllable-pitch propellers
in Boeing transports copied by the Germans that impelled
them to develop their own propellers. The moral seems to be that
leadership in scientific research and technological development is
the key to military security. A laggard faces extinction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWENTY">CHAPTER TWENTY<br>
Igor Sikorsky Spans Two Gaps</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">On the ninth floor of the New York Central Building, at 230 Park
Avenue in the city of New York, Frederick B. Rentschler, president
of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, sat behind his
desk in a corner office that looked out on the Biltmore Hotel, and
welcomed me with a grin. It was a May day in 1930.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a problem in Bridgeport,” he began. “It’s Sikorsky
Aviation Corporation. They need management, and I thought you
might like to take it on in addition to Hamilton-Standard.”</p>

<p>United Aircraft and Transport, it seemed, had been originally
conceived as a consolidation of outstanding manufacturers for
military and air transport. However, back in 1928 when it was being
set up, Fred had encountered considerable pressure from certain ones
“downtown” to include some outstanding private commercial manufacturers
as well. Some in Wall Street had become convinced that
the day of private flying had already dawned, and they had drawn
the analogy with the automobile somewhat closer, it had seemed to
Fred, than was warranted by the facts. While he resisted their
pressure, he did agree to take over a few outstanding commercial
manufacturers like Stearman in Wichita and Sikorsky in Bridgeport.</p>

<p>And when the bottom had dropped out of the stock market, and
the fool’s paradise that characterized the late ’twenties had faded into
the deep depression now steeping the country in gloom and fear,
Fred’s judgment had been vindicated. At Sikorsky, a flock of “firm
orders,” with down payments from Curtiss-Wright Flying Service,
had been transformed into a big inventory surplus. Somebody must
now liquidate that to get enough cash to continue, and somebody
must create something to sell to the Army and Navy, the only remaining
users of aircraft. That somebody could be me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“When you get up to Stratford,” Fred told me, “you’ll find an
organization that is unique to say the least.”</p>

<p>Practically every one in the company was a Russian—a White
Russian refugee who, “come the revolution,” had made his precarious
way to the United States. They were all talented, artistic,
intellectual, and by our standards at least, wholly impractical.</p>

<p>Igor Sikorsky was their guiding genius, a man around whom all
had rallied when the going was tough. Over on College Point, Long
Island, at an abandoned chicken farm, they had pooled their resources
for the common good and built their first twin-engined
bomber. And so successful had this ship been that Arnold Dickinson,
an enterprising fellow from Fitchburg, Massachusetts, who had been
greatly attracted to the fascinating Russians and much impressed
by their cleverness, had advanced them large sums of money. Then
came the Sikorsky twin-engined amphibian, one of the first American
aircraft to control and maneuver well on either of its two
engines, and with its success, United Aircraft became interested in
taking the company into the fold. By that time, Sikorsky’s backers
had built a modern plant for him at Stratford on the Housatonic
River, and things had looked promising indeed up until that Black
Friday of October, 1929, when the bottom dropped out of the
stock market.</p>

<p>It happened that I had flown the Sikorsky amphibian and had
met Mr. Sikorsky. He had called on me in BUAERO and left
with us a vivid impression of his charm of manner, his intellectual
honesty, his resourceful mind, and—unique in our experience—a
most becoming modesty. For at a time when fast-talking promoters
had beaten paths to our doorway, in the hope of high pressuring
us into buying their mousetraps, the Russian designer alone had
shown humility with respect to his art and respect for the judgment
of others. And with it all, being himself without guile, Mr. Igor
Sikorsky had proved himself the most convincing salesman in our
rather wide experience. For sitting as we had at the crossroads, we
had had the advantage of a good view along all highways.</p>

<p>Now I learned from Fred Rentschler that there was another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
complication of the kind Mr. Sikorsky later sometimes referred
to, in his delightful accent and his literal-English translation of an
old American saying—“Somewhere there is a Negro sawing wood.”
Pan American Airways, during the boom, had advertised a competition
calling for large flying boats or amphibians, to be flown on its
Caribbean and South American air routes, where practically no
airports were available. Sikorsky Aviation, it appeared, had won the
award and had agreed to build three of the giant craft at an average
price of $125,000 each. After having spent at least that much on
engineering alone, they had decided to throw the drawings away
and start anew with a clean sheet of paper. Fred Rentschler had been
a member of the Pan American Airways board of directors during
the competition, and now felt that United was committed to go on
with the project. He had reconciled himself to the fact that it
would cost United upwards of a million dollars, and had even concluded
that the money could be looked upon as an investment. If
the planes proved successful, we might get back our money and more
too, by selling airplanes, propellers, and engines to the new commercial
airline. In a way, one might persuade himself that it was
United’s duty to make such a contribution to the art.</p>

<p>This idea, while commendable in spirit, seemed to me somewhat
fantastic in practice. Some years earlier, “Captain Dick” Richardson,
a naval constructor, designer and pilot for the giant NC boats that
had crossed the Atlantic, and himself a pioneer pilot, had carefully
analyzed the economics of commercial operations and solemnly
concluded that airplanes in excess of thirty thousand pounds gross
weight could not possibly pay their freight, let alone produce revenue.
At that time there had been no controllable-pitch propellers
in sight, nor had wing flaps appeared on the horizon; Captain Dick’s
dictum had become an axiom. In view of this, it seemed to me wise
for us to attempt to dissuade Juan Trippe, President of Pan American,
from his foolhardy undertaking. When, later on, we tried to
do so, Juan could not be sold. He, like Igor Sikorsky, had that
intuitive something that motivates the pioneer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back there in the New York office, Fred Rentschler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
continued to explain the complexities of the Sikorsky problem. At
this point, J. F. McCarthy, United’s controller, who had sat through
the whole discussion, began unrolling several of those long yellow
ruled sheets of paper on which accountants were accustomed to line
up their figures.</p>

<p>Mac had broken the Sikorsky expenses down into the usual three
categories, general and sales expense, engineering expense, and
manufacturing expense. Now it appeared, the ratios of these expenses
to one another and to shipments, sales, and so on, were far out
of line with good practice. There were certain items in each that
were more or less fixed, but manufacturing expense now looked
like the best point of attack; it was a large part of the whole; it had
large reducible items and it could be cut without serious harm. In
other words my job was to go down to Stratford and fire enough
of these attractive Russians to bring the expense into line. Fred
summed it up this way:</p>

<p>“There is a limit to the contribution United Aircraft can make
to Russian relief.”</p>

<p>And so, next day I took a morning train from Grand Central. The
new Sikorsky factory lay just below the town of Stratford and
just above the point where the Housatonic River empties into Long
Island Sound. It was a sheltered spot and had been selected as possessing
good seaplane facilities with space for a landing field nearby.
From the outside, the high factory buildings looked new and shiny,
but as I entered the door I thought that someone had cut corners on
the details of construction.</p>

<p>After Arnold Dickinson had arrived, we went to work. Arnold
appreciated the problems, but hesitated to move in on them. That
remained for me, and now I began the unpleasant task that would
burden me for many years. For the good of the organization and
the salvation of jobs for the many, I must separate from our companies
many delightful people, men who, though warm personal
friends, just did not seem to have what it took to keep the wheels
turning. The task was heartbreaking but the penalties for shirking
it were inexorable. All one could do was try to perform his duty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the company with utmost fairness and kindness, and without impairing
the morale of the individual or organization beyond the
absolute minimum. This was a job that needed doing all at once; it
must not be dragged. And so my first act at Sikorsky was to issue
orders that the manufacturing expense be reduced by 20 per cent,
and forthwith. The method of accomplishing this would be left
to the local management.</p>

<p>That, however, did not work too well at Stratford. The cut in
manufacturing expense seemed to create not a single ripple; I soon
discovered why: engineering expense had suddenly skyrocketed.
And when I ordered it restored to its original level—I did not deem
it wise to cut back further for fear it might impair the engineering
on the Pan American project—the Sikorsky management “agreed
with me 100 per cent” as they were wont to express it in their Russian
slang. But I soon found out why; the direct labor skyrocketed. Evidently
these Russian intellectuals, refugees from their own land,
were so versatile that they could play any position on the team—infield,
outfield, or umpire. The organization was like a balloon; you
could press your finger on one side and make a dent, but the other
side bulged out—and less obviously. And when I took my new organization
to task, they always “agreed with me 100 per cent,” and
then proceeded to do precisely as they jolly well pleased.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we got on with the Pan American S-40’s, as they
came to be called, though this project proved to have more angles
than the Kohinoor diamond, and threatened to cost about as much.
While the specifications for the first Pan American Clippers had been
reviewed by Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, Pan American advisor, and
incorporated into the contract, they didn’t mean a thing. Before
Pan American would take delivery on the plane it must be passed
by the Department of Commerce and given an Approved Type
Certificate as to its airworthiness. Without this ATC, Sikorsky
might be left with a million dollars’ worth of airplanes and no market.
Now Pan American, our sole customer, used this advantage to insist
on our incorporating in the ships everything its own engineers or
our prolific innovators could dream up, from swivel-handled toilets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
to back-lighted card tables. Thus our designs were kept in a state
of continuous flux—at company expense. Save for the redeeming
qualities of Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky himself, it is hard to imagine
what might have become of us.</p>

<p>A man of strong convictions, for all his humbleness, he was
a brilliant engineer though never a “clever” one. Thoroughly
grounded in science and mathematics and accustomed to reason from
fundamental principles to valid conclusions, he possessed to an
astonishing degree those powers with which to divine a true course
even when the signposts were not clearly marked. This capacity
he once called “intuitive engineering” without for the moment
ascribing that quality of genius to himself.</p>

<p>Thanks to Igor Sikorsky’s personal leadership, we finally completed
delivery of the first three Pan American Clippers. While
United absorbed a heavy loss on them, none of this resulted from
changes made necessary by official ATC tests. Unlike other companies
that later suffered severe losses from this cause, Sikorsky
always managed to pass the tests in a remarkably short time, even
though radical design features were involved. As for Pan American,
that company used the airplanes to lug tons of mail, cargo, and
passengers over the high seas for many years. The ships paved the
way for a later model that disproved “Dick” Richardson’s formula,
hurdled the last long barrier, San Francisco to Hawaii, and pointed
the way to overseas air transport by land planes. It is not unlikely
that Fred Rentschler’s investment paid off in the long run, if not on
the books of Sikorsky, on those of Pratt and Whitney and Hamilton-Standard.</p>

<p>With the Clippers behind us, we now had the choice of two
courses: first, we could shut down Sikorsky and save further losses;
or second, we could reorganize it and try to exploit the genius of
Igor Sikorsky without prohibitive losses. There seemed no way to
anticipate earning a profit in the near future; whatever we tried
must be for the long pull. But one thing we had definitely determined:
it was too much to expect our friends, the Russian refugees,
to implement the American techniques of production. Not that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
could not understand them, for they did understand and admire the
extraordinary manifestation of applied science that went under that
banner. The problem was rather one of temperament or national
character.</p>

<p>It was not until the middle of World War II that I heard this
thought advanced by Charles A. Lindbergh, one of Mr. Sikorsky’s
most devoted friends and an ardent admirer. The conversation took
place much later, but before the war had involved this country.
By that time I had become president of United Aircraft, and had
persuaded Lindbergh to join our organization in the capacity of a
personal advisor to me. The conversation took place in our home
in Hartford, on one of the many stimulating evenings my wife and
I were to enjoy with Lindbergh. He had been outlining those views
on the European situation which had involved him in so much
misunderstanding. Having been in Russia and Germany and, like
his father before him, having ardently hoped for peace for his own
country, he had feared that, in joining with Russia to defeat Hitler,
we would bring about those very things which have since justified
his concern.</p>

<p>He thought that nations, like people, displayed traits of fundamental
character that were distinct and unchanging. These had had
hereditary origins and had been influenced by environment. They
influenced the attitudes of nations toward specific circumstances
and conditions and especially tended to determine the attitude of
a nation toward war as an instrument of policy and to dictate the
methods by which it prosecuted a war. The character of the Russians
and that of the American people, he thought, differs as night differs
from day. Theirs had been a tradition of compulsion, ours of cooperation.
If in competition with them we tried to use their methods,
we must prove quite as inept as would they in trying to use ours.
But if we had the wit to exploit our own ideology to the limit, we
must surely overcome the inferior authoritarian process. He saw
the problem in its spiritual rather than material light.</p>

<p>Now if consideration of matters like this appears somewhat academic,
the fact remains that they were fundamental to our decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
as to what to do with Sikorsky. On the one hand, it was clear that
in trying to operate the plant we would assume heavy management
burdens with little hope of financial reward; on the other, it was
certain that there was a pearl in the Sikorsky oyster which, unless
we dived for it, would remain quite undiscovered. Our willingness
to accept the risk of further operations there must depend upon
our confidence in the collateral benefits. This, in turn, must be
based entirely upon the quality of leadership we ourselves could
display. And so, after much soul searching, we decided to gamble
on our own abilities to direct the genius of Igor Sikorsky so as to
benefit the art, if not to swell the treasury.</p>

<p>With this decision taken, we cut the organization back sharply
to the double handful of men Mr. Sikorsky himself deemed vital
to his success. These included, among others, the brothers Gluhareff,
Michael and Serge, Bob Lebensky, of the experimental shop, and
Buivid of the laboratory. With the organization set, I stated the
problem as that involving the creation of a large flying boat so
designed that, when operated on the Pan American system, it could
earn its board and keep. In other words, we must move the upper
limit of the Richardson formula as high as necessary to gain our
objectives. As one contribution to this project, we had the new
Hamilton-Standard controllable-pitch propeller, then under development;
as another we had a complementary development of Mr.
Sikorsky’s, a new wing-flapped airfoil. The propeller could pull
more weight into the air and fly it; the flaps could help it into the air
and get it back on the water at a reasonable stalling speed. This made
the flying-boat hull the controlling factor; its characteristics limited
the load we could drag into the air with our new wing and new
propellers. To refine the lines of the boat hull, our engineers now
devised an inexpensive but effective test rig; they towed a model hull
alongside a speed boat and photographed its action in rough or
smooth water with slow-motion cameras.</p>

<p>And while we pushed on with our concept of a wholly new design
in which we would accept no compromise that impaired the economy
of operation, we all sweated out the days and nights of tests and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
experiments. But there was one critical item on which I did no sweating.
Had Mr. Sikorsky revealed to me the fact that the wing loading
he had selected would be too high to conform to the current Department
of Commerce requirements, and that he would have to
sell the Department a new concept of landing in a power stall before
he could get his ship accepted, I am sure I should not have had
the courage to risk all that money on his persuasive qualities. As it
was, he kept me in ignorance of the risk, assumed it wholly to himself,
and let me know about it only after he had made his sale. The
principle of high wing loadings, involving a new type of approach
and landing, is now so thoroughly accepted that few pilots know
how it came about. The principle is inherent in current air economics
and the limits have gone steadily upward. In 1927 I had solemnly announced
for the Design Section of BUAERO that we would not
consider wing loadings in excess of 10.5 pounds per square foot.
Today, the new Boeing Stratocruiser utilizes loadings eight times
that high.</p>

<p>And so Igor Sikorsky built the famous S-42’s, forty-passenger flying
boats, designed to hop from New York to Bermuda to the
Azores and to Portugal on what was called the “stepping-stones”
route to Europe. So well did he design the planes that, when the
British refused to give Pan American landing rights at Bermuda
because they had no similar boat with which to match the service,
Pan American turned westward to the Pacific and used the new
Clippers to pioneer the run to Australia, the Philippines, and China.
On this run the controlling factor was the great distance to Honolulu,
2,400 miles against 1,900 miles from Bermuda to the Azores, but
the Sikorsky boat hulls, derived from model-towing tests, could
take off nearly 20 per cent more load than that originally contemplated.
Thus they removed the last barrier to overseas air commerce.</p>

<p>From the United point of view, while we made no money on the
transaction, and, accounting-wise, lost a hundred thousand dollars
on the ten ships, cash-wise we bore no out-of-pocket loss. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
while the project took a lot of nervous and physical energy out of
management, it paid dividends to the aviation art as a whole. Meanwhile
we kept our eyes open for a chance to work into some Army
or Navy business, though a number of important changes had taken
place.</p>

<p>First of all, shortly after President Roosevelt had been inaugurated,
Postmaster James Farley had canceled the air-mail contracts and
Senators Black and Nye had broken out in a rash of Congressional
investigations. These had upset the five-year procurement programs
of both Army and Navy and reacted adversely upon many manufacturers.
For a while, Admiral Moffett had held the fort, but then a
great tragedy had deprived aviation of one of its foremost figures at
its time of greatest need.</p>

<p>The admiral, continuing his absorption with the development of
lighter-than-air craft, had succeeded in building and operating the
<em>Macon</em> and the <em>Akron</em> and had established a new field near San Jose,
California, one that now carries his name. Here the <em>Macon</em> carried
out operations with the fleet until an unfortunate accident resulted
in her complete loss. The Old Man, still faithful to the rigid airship,
continued to fly in them himself until the night the <em>Akron</em>
sailed out over the Atlantic and was destroyed. The admiral was
lost at sea along with other gallant airmen, close friends and classmates
of mine. The loss was disastrous enough from the personal
angle, for Admiral Moffett was loved and admired by all his aeronautic
organization to a degree seldom attained by any man. Coming
as it did at the time of greatest trial on the political front, it deprived
us of the one person who might have guided us through our
worst rocks and shoals. The admiral was buried at Arlington along
with so many of the young lads he had inspired. With his passing,
gloom settled over us all.</p>

<p>When Adm. E. J. King succeeded to command of BUAERO,
he brought to it a type of leadership quite different from that which
had characterized its thirteen years under Admiral Moffett. Admiral
King, who was one day to become Commander in Chief during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
World War II, was a man of strong convictions who made his
own decisions. With his brilliant intellect and decisive manner, he
dominated the Bureau completely.</p>

<p>The cancellation of air-mail contracts set off a chain reaction that
disrupted the whole United Aircraft and Transport structure. To
comply with the law requiring separation of manufacturing companies
from transport organizations, United Airlines was split off
into a separate company known as United Airlines Transport Corporation.
With the transport link between the eastern and western
manufacturing groups thus disrupted, we divided them into two
separate companies. The four Connecticut companies, Pratt and
Whitney, Hamilton-Standard, Chance Vought, and Sikorsky, comprised
the new United Aircraft Corporation. The western group
took the name of Boeing Airplane Company.</p>

<p>In the reorganization, William E. Boeing severed all his aviation
connections. Frederick B. Rentschler resigned the presidency of
United. Phillip G. Johnson, deprived by law of his right to manage
the airlines, later moved to Canada to create the great Trans-Canada
Airlines. Donald L. Brown moved up from Pratt and Whitney to
become president of United Aircraft Corporation, and I became its
senior vice-president. Thus a Congressional investigation that proved
no wrongdoing deprived the country of the services of three outstanding
pioneers.</p>

<p>President Roosevelt had, meanwhile, appointed Admiral Reeves
Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. Having in mind the
progress of events in the Pacific, I had undertaken a study of a big
boat designed to scout its vast areas, using available harbors as bases
of operations. About the time the job was completed, the admiral
invited me to join him on the <em>California</em>, at Hampton Roads, to
watch the aircraft carriers in operation. Frank Wagner, his Operations
officer, met me at Old Point Comfort and the admiral himself
greeted me at the gangway. The bulkheads of his cabin had been
papered with charts of the Pacific, evidence enough of the Old Man’s
absorption with that problem. When, after lunch, he developed his
estimate of the Pacific situation and asked if I thought it possible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
build a flying boat capable of patrolling the area, I was able to produce
from my brief case exactly what the doctor had ordered. The
hearty laugh with which Bull Reeves greeted this legerdemain
brought back memories of the happy days of FLEET AIR.</p>

<p>Under pressure from the fleet, BUAERO, which at this time was
absorbed in carrier aircraft and about ready to wash up big boats,
invited bids on which Sikorsky won the award. As the designs progressed,
BUAERO developed increasing interest in the project and
finally authorized a second development by Consolidated Aircraft
of San Diego. In the competition for the production order, Sikorsky
lost out to Consolidated on price, but the Sikorsky design was selected
by the new transoceanic operator, American Export Airlines,
for whom we built three passenger ships. The American line,
organized and operated under the able leadership of John Slater,
provided nonstop flying-boat service from New York to Foynes,
Ireland, and during the war provided comfortable berths for many
very important people while many others of the same character
shivered in bucket seats in hastily improvised land-plane service via
Newfoundland, Iceland, and the Azores. In other words, Sikorsky
flying boats showed the way to transoceanic service and, at the
moment, actually outperformed the land plane.</p>

<p>However, even under such fair terms as those granted us by
American Export Airlines, we did not succeed in avoiding serious
losses at Sikorsky. Meanwhile, Pan American had turned to Martin
and then Boeing, and each of these able builders had suffered
similarly. By that time, too, the aircraft industry had suffered
from the political debacle in Washington. We had reached the
end of our rope and could no longer afford to contribute either our
management or engineering talents, let alone our slender capital,
to the subsidization of airline operations. We decided to drop out of
the big-boat business.</p>

<p>And when I broke this sad news to Mr. Sikorsky—by then I had
become president of United Aircraft—he received it like the great
gentleman he is. He understood our problem; he was grateful for
all the consideration the company had given him. He wondered if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
perchance we would grant him one more favor; he would like to go
back to his first love—experimenting with helicopters. He thought
he might succeed now where he had failed before. A modest sum of
money would meet his requirements and he hoped this was not
asking too much.</p>

<p>Quite certain that no one could possibly build a successful helicopter
but that Mr. Sikorsky at least deserved a try, I magnanimously
agreed to back him. Igor Sikorsky did invent the helicopter,
just as the Wrights before him had invented the airplane, by diligent
study, by painstaking experiment, by teaching himself to fly and
then teaching others. In so doing, the man who had given the world
the means of vaulting the last barrier to air commerce went to the
other extreme to create the only vehicle that can operate in three
dimensions without a prepared surface from which to take off or
land. Aviation owes much to his creative mind, one that not only
finds no difficulty in reconciling science and religious faith, but on
the contrary, exercises that intuitive quality that marks real genius.</p>

<p>The moral of this brief review of the history of a representative
airplane company is that profit has a counterpart in loss, and both
are essential to progress. Again, financial results are not the sole
measure of excellence; there is also the intangible factor of stewardship.
When the final account is cast up, Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky
will rank among the immortals of American aviation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWENTY-ONE">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE<br>
The Courage of Conviction</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">One of the important considerations that had influenced my decision
to resign from the Navy had been my desire to work on constructive
tasks with men whose competence I had admired. Among
these were Fred Rentschler, Bill Boeing, George Mead, Claire
Egtvedt, George Wheat, Don Brown, Phil Johnson, and Chance
Vought. As fate dealt the cards, however, the decade of 1930 saw
the passing of Chance, George, and Don, and of these, Chance was
the first. During the summer of 1930, after I had added Sikorsky to
my responsibilities, Chance died of septicemia, something which
today would respond quickly to the new drugs. With him, much of
the sparkle went out of United Aircraft.</p>

<p>By the time I joined United, Chance had already come to realize
that his famous Corsair two-seater, which had done so well on
battleship catapults and carrier decks, had all but been outmoded
by the passage of time alone. And he was at a loss to know what
to do about it, and talked far into the night about that problem. His
untimely death relieved him of all necessity for further worry, but it
also handed the job to me. Worse still, the Vought company, like
most other aviation concerns, had always been a one-man show
and there were no more Chance Voughts standing around to be
hired, even with more jobless men around than the country had ever
known. And so we faced the task of creating a new organization—one
of a type then new to aviation—of developing some new
product and of marketing it in what was becoming a tough market
indeed. In this job we pinned our hopes on some of the old-timers
in the Vought organization and on a relative newcomer, Charles J.
McCarthy.</p>

<p>“C.J.,” as we called him, to differentiate the airplane engineer from
“J.F.,” the financial wizard, had been in BUAERO in charge of the
new department called “Stress Analysis” at the time when I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
been chief of the Engine Section. It was C.J. who had flown to
Norfolk with me the day the Wright T-3 engine jumped out of a
torpedo bomber when the wooden propeller flew apart, and it had
been out of that experience that we decided to standardize on metal
propellers. It was curious how, in the aviation slipstream, we milled
around, each trying to add his little push to the effective forward
thrust. For Chance had offered C.J. a job in his company, and C.J.
had accepted. Now I began to look upon him as my second there,
and between us we decided to bring in a new chief engineer.</p>

<p>The newcomer was Rex Beisel, a man who had received good
training in the old school of Curtiss Airplane Company but had gone
west to create a new private airplane. The stock-market crash had
made Rex available and we now promptly scooped him up. We
thought Rex a bit opinionated, and expected to have to handle him
roughly at times, but we knew there was great capacity there. And
in this we were right, for Rex created a strong engineering organization
as a substitute for the genius of Chance Vought, and came
ultimately to head the Vought Division in his own right. The story
of how this was done, like the story of Hamilton-Standard, or
Sikorsky, or Pratt and Whitney, or any of the great independent
outfits like Grumman, or Martin, or Douglas, or Boeing, is worth
a book in itself; but for our purposes here we can sweep in only
those high lights that seem to back light the slipstream itself. And
though the several stories run concurrently, we are concerned more
with events than with precise timing.</p>

<p>There was, however, one vital factor that influenced the performance
of every aircraft company, and in the end, imperiled the
existence of them all. For while the creative force of the Morrow
Board policy carried over beyond the 1929 stock-market crash, it
did not survive the ordeal of the New Deal. With the election of
President Roosevelt in 1932 and his advent into the White House
in 1933, an earthquake hit American aviation. When President
Roosevelt ordered the cancellation of the air-mail contracts and
directed the Army to take over, the young air-transport business
suffered a vital blow. When, after the deaths of several Army pilots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
who had had no preparation for the complex transport task, the
lines were returned to private operations, the blight of Congressional
investigation fell upon the whole aircraft industry.</p>

<p>Senator Hugo Black, later a Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States, who had been probing the ocean-mail subsidies, now
turned his attention to aviation. The airplane, long a subject of
great public interest, crowded the headlines with sensational charges
and countercharges, none of which seemed to lead anywhere other
than to the glorification of the investigators. Then Senator Gerald
P. Nye, not to be outdone in courtesy, dragged out the old myth
of the “munitions racketeer” and the “merchants of death” and
dusted it off for the more modern treatment of klieg lights and other
technological advances in the art of public relations. Whatever else
may be said for these hippodromes, they had the effect of knocking
down an airplane program just as a killer in the stockyards fells an
ox with one neat blow from a maul. Even though the programs remained
on the statute books, it would have required a courageous
procurement staff, indeed, to make contracts with such apparent
renegades as headed the unhappy aircraft companies.</p>

<p>The moment arrived when Chance Vought Aircraft was running
out of work. In order to extend the useful life of the old Corsair,
we had replaced the Wasp engine with a new Pratt and Whitney
Hornet 1690. This gave us a breathing spell while we assembled
our engineering team and dreamed up a new model. But BUAERO
had now revived the old two-seat fighter project and thrust it on us.
Worse still, they had designed the airplane themselves and now
looked to us to detail it and build the prototype. Recalling the old
fight between FLEET AIR and BUAERO on this subject, back
when I had been Admiral Reeves’s chief of staff, the whole thing
had elements of poetic injustice in it that now aroused me to action.
I decided to build their old two-seat fighter, according to all specifications,
to exceed their designed performances, and at the same time
build the structure strong enough to be used as a dive bomber. This
would take a lot of doing, for the performance guarantees were
already high, but it would leave us with two strings to our bow, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
two-seat fighter that would probably not go into production, and
a two-seat dive bomber that probably would. In the latter event,
Vought would give the Navy a distinctly new type of airplane, one
that could depend upon its guns to penetrate enemy fighter cover
and then use its bombs on ground targets.</p>

<p>One of the complications involved was the specification that
called for the installation of the new Pratt and Whitney two-row
radial, the R-1535. The two-row feature would have introduced
excessive drag and cooling difficulties, except that I chanced to read
an article by C. G. Grey in <em>The Airplane</em>, a British magazine devoted
to aviation and to running down everything American. Mr. Grey
had recently visited the great Bristol airplane factory and had been
impressed with a project for cooling air-cooled engines. Unlike
certain foreign engine builders who insisted on blowing large quantities
of air in the general direction of their cylinders, Bristol had devised
an ingenious contrivance through which they had succeeded
in directing a “mere trickle” of air at precisely the required spots,
thus saving much drag and improving the cooling no end.</p>

<p>After this tip-off, we set up a joint project using the Sikorsky wind
tunnel and staff, under the direction of Chance Vought engineers,
to develop a cowl for a Pratt and Whitney engine. Out of this
cooperative effort came a new power-plant installation using the
“cowl-flaps” which any passenger in any American transport can
still see by looking out the window at the engine nacelle and watching
the opening and closing of the “gills.” This development not
only made the two-row radial a success but proved so effective that
it has been rated by discerning observers as a development quite
as revolutionary in its way as was the controllable-angle propeller.</p>

<p>With the drying up of both military and commercial business in
our own country, we must needs look elsewhere or fade out. The
export market was the only outlet, and while there were obstacles
there, the superiority of our products, built up under the Morrow
policy, had put us in a strong competitive position. Even from the
point of view of costs and in the face of a preference on the part of
some countries for aircraft of their own production, we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
still make headway. American automobiles had won leadership in
foreign markets because of superior quality and lower price. The
idea that we could not compete with “slave labor” had been disproved;
the technology of production could support higher wages
and still produce low-cost goods of high quality. That was our
heritage which we would now exploit.</p>

<p>However, there were other considerations. The control of export
permits had been lodged in the State Department, which would
not grant such permit without the approval of the military department
concerned. In the case of the SBU-1 two-seat dive bomber
we had first to obtain permission from BUAERO and then run
the gantlet of the State Department and the office of a Mr. Joseph
Green. This problem came to the fore when the Argentine Navy
sought to acquire some of our planes. Admiral King ruled that since
the airplane had the characteristics of a dive bomber it was too secret
to permit foreign sale. Of course the only secret about it was that
the wings had been made strong enough to take the pull-out loads—something
any designer could build in—but that proved enough.</p>

<p>Chance Vought Aircraft now found itself in a tight spot. I camped
on the doorstep of the State Department, of BUAERO, and even
went to see Adm. William H. Standley, then Chief of Naval Operations,
to urge that the matter be viewed from the point of view of
the long-term public interest, keeping a vital industry alive and 800
men and women employed. We already had millions on relief without
swelling the throng on a technicality, but I was too poor a salesman
to make the idea stick. In desperation, I tried another approach.</p>

<p>With my wife as company, I caught a Pan American Airways
flight for Buenos Aires, determined to close the contract and then
see what Uncle Sam had to say. If he wanted to accept the responsibility
for an overt act that would take the food from the mouths
of our men, he could do so, but I refused to hold the bag while they
gave me the run-around.</p>

<p>We were fortunate in our representation in Argentina. The firm
of Jorge Luro y Cia. brought us the experience of Jorge Luro, a
distinguished pioneer aviator, and the mature wisdom of Señor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Guillermo Leloir, member of an aristocratic Argentine family.</p>

<p>“We Latins,” Guillermo counseled me, in anticipation of direct
negotiations with Capt. Marco Zar, the director of Argentine naval
aviation, “admire your North American enterprise but resent your
high-pressure salesmanship.”</p>

<p>Marco Zar, a graduate of the Pensacola Naval Air Station, had
come to me one day in BUAERO, asking for advice on his procurement
problems. His current interest in Vought airplanes was
due to his knowledge that I managed the company. An earnest,
conscientious officer, he believed that a good deal for his service
must needs be a fair deal all around. My tactics during the negotiations
were predicated on this fact plus the advice from Guillermo.</p>

<p>Details of our contract were argued out before a large conference
of Captain Zar’s subordinate officers. The captain won every
skirmish pertaining to prices or specification, yet the final conclusions
were satisfactory to all concerned. When I returned to
Hartford, I passed the word around the shop that the kids could
eat for another year, provided Uncle Sam did not refuse us an export
permit.</p>

<p>With work for the shop we could direct our attention to a new
development. It was already clear that biplanes were being outclassed
by monoplanes, but they had persisted longer on carriers
because of the space limitations imposed there. As a replacement
for our two-seat dive bomber, which could carry a 500-pound
bomb, we drew up a proposal to construct a folding-wing 500-pound
monoplane dive bomber so designed that a carrier could
manage its full complement of the new, faster type. The Bureau
considered the proposal for a while, and then, instead of giving us
the advantage we deserved for having conceived the idea, got out
its own specification and published it to the trade. Then they further
complicated the problem by advertising for two types, a 500- and a
1,000-pounder. We submitted proposals for both, and were awarded
the 500-pound model. Now in order not to get left at the post in case
BUAERO finally decided to buy only 1,000-pounders, we decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
to build our ship to meet all the tight specifications for the smaller
size but still capable of carrying a 1,000-pound bomb.</p>

<p>The competition from other manufacturers was tough. Every airplane
was stressed to the ultimate and no margins were left for error.
After winning a design competition, a manufacturer had to submit
an article for test by the trial board at Anacostia. If he beat out his
competitors there and won a production award, then followed the
trials and tribulations of trying to build his brain child without losing
his shirt. Then, after the airplane got into service and developed the
unforeseen bugs that always show up regardless of previous care, he
had the added responsibility for correcting faults on aircraft he
might have donated to the government at a substantial loss to himself.
After that, all that remained was to dream up a new model to
replace the old, and in the meantime, keep service men in the field to
show untrained mechanics how to operate a complicated contraption
that was fully as high strung as the president of the company that had
built it.</p>

<p>After our new SB2U went into service, we shifted our attention
back to building a monoplane observation replacement for the battleship
and carrier-catapult planes, represented by our original Corsairs.
For so well had Chance Vought wrought that his little two-seaters,
conceived back there in 1926, remained in service until after
Pearl Harbor, some fifteen years later. Our replacement was called
the “Kingfisher” and it saw service in World War II. One of them
saved Eddy Rickenbacker from a watery grave on the vast Pacific,
something that alone compensated us for the painstaking design efforts
we had put into a complicated project.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the effort to find a product for export sale and,
possibly, break into an Army competition, we built a fighter under
circumstances so fantastic as almost to belie the telling. Jack
Northrup, who had built a sweet little single-seater for the Army,
using the Wright 1510 two-row engine, had won high praise from
the Army Engineering Division at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio,
in competition with fighters by Curtiss and Seversky. But during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
an interlude in the contest, after the plane had gone back to California,
it had sailed out over the broad Pacific and not returned.
There had been gossip at the time that the Japs might have had
something to do with it. At any rate, Jack Northrup had decided not
to reenter the Army competition, but Jack Horner, sales manager
of Pratt and Whitney, suggested that Vought take over the design
from Northrup, reconstruct the model around the Pratt and Whitney
1535 engine, and create an export fighter model for United Aircraft.</p>

<p>I conducted the negotiations with Jack Northrup over the telephone
and sent our men west by air. Starting with few drawings
and no materials, we rushed the airplane to completion in something
like forty-five days. During the work at East Hartford, the Connecticut
River overflowed its banks and cut off the electric power,
but our crews, working night and day, finished the little ship in the
light of their automobile headlights.</p>

<p>In the competition at Wright Field, which was based not on the
actual performance of the prototype but on what the contractor
was willing to guarantee in production, we lost out to Alex Seversky.
When we offered the airplane to the Navy, with arresting gear, we
were unable to arouse interest. While this put us in the clear for an
export permit, we failed to sell any of the craft, at least to countries
with cash to buy them. One day our European export representative,
Tom Hamilton, brought some Japanese officers to Hartford.</p>

<p>When the Jap pilot put the little fighter through its paces, we
looked at one another in wonderment. We had long understood that
these boys couldn’t learn to fly—they had myopic eyes. But whatever
else the Japs had, this pilot had everything; he didn’t put on any
dive-and-zoom noise show, but checked out the little airplane especially
as to its maneuverability at altitude, the characteristic at which
it excelled. And so with the full approval of Washington, the plane,
which had been rejected by both Army and Navy, was sold to the
Japanese.</p>

<p>Later on in the Pacific war, their fighter pilots proved quite
proficient in the air. Furthermore, their fleet fighters, the Zeros,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
could give even our Grumman Wildcats plenty of trouble. Finally
one of their Zeros was captured and brought to San Diego where,
after passing severe tests by the guards, I was permitted to see it.
It was bigger than our Northrup-Vought and powered with a Japanese
two-row radial of about the size of our 1830. The engine was
of Japanese design but incorporated what the Japs considered to
be the best features of the French Gnome-Rhone radials, the British
Bristol Jupiter, the Wright Cyclone, and the Pratt and Whitney
Wasp. And it displayed beautiful workmanship throughout.</p>

<p>As for the airplane, it looked a good deal like the Northrup-Vought,
though it was larger and incorporated some of the best features
of other aircraft bought by the Japanese, as well as some neat
wrinkles of their own. The power-plant installation was distinctly
Chance Vought Aircraft, and the wheel stowage into the wing roots
was definitely Northrup. The wing-tip folding was Japanese, and it
looked like an idea we should have used. All in all, it was a masterful
example of good imitation—they even copied the Navy inspection
stamp from the Pratt and Whitney type parts—plus some good
Jap innovation which combined to make the product of an “inferior
race” all too devastating. As Admiral Reeves had been wont to
remark, “One should never discount an enemy.”</p>

<p>But while the Japs had been busy with their Zeros, we had not
been idle at Vought. I, for one, had not forgotten the lesson of
Panama, even though our Navy now seemed to have turned its back
on the fighter-bomber idea. Fighter pilots are inherently resentful
of any suggestion that they should know how to dive bomb as well
as dogfight. But the fact remains that, once they have driven an
enemy from the skies, neither they nor their ships are useful unless
they can turn a hand at attacking objectives on the ground. With
this idea in mind, we set out at Vought to build a new Corsair. She
must be able to out-perform enemy fighters and still be readily
convertible to a dive bomber; she must have the structural ruggedness
and strength to withstand the high stresses of this work. This
meant, in turn, that she must be larger than the pure fighter and to
this end she must have a more powerful engine. That is just another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
way of expressing Bruce Leighton’s ancient adage about the power
plant being the heart of the airplane.</p>

<p>We had such an engine in the new Pratt and Whitney 2800.
Originally intended to develop from 1,800 to 2,000 horsepower, this
engine was later actually used at from 2,500 to 3,000 in World
War II. Around the new power plant we designed a new fighter
bomber, and offered it to BUAERO in anticipation of the war that
seemed inevitable. But BUAERO was cool to our proposal. Large
airplanes could not be carried on the flattops in the same numbers
as could the smaller, more compact fighters; number was an important
factor in the complement of a carrier. They were willing to
let us go ahead on the project, but they could not hold out much
hope for ultimate production.</p>

<p>Now I took a long breath and embarked on the gamble of a lifetime.
We would commit Chance Vought to a new single-seat fighter,
one with such blazing speed and such fire power and such maneuverability
that it could blast any enemy from the skies, even though
handicapped with all the rigging that goes on a carrier fighter. We
would build into it such rugged strength that it could carry heavy
bombs in a dive, and still withstand the clumsiness of any horny-handed
pilot who might try to pull its tail off.</p>

<p>But in taking this kind of decision we were not alone. Out in
Seattle, Boeing had staked its future on the conviction of the Young
Turks of the Army that a long-range heavy bomber would one
day become the backbone of air power, no matter who said it
would not. Farther down the West Coast, Don Douglas risked
everything on the future of a new four-engined transport to be
called the “DC-4” at a time when the Army remained cold to
all transport and the airlines were doing very well, thank you, with
the DC-3. Across the city, Bob Gross, at Lockheed, took his chances
with a new twin-engined liquid-cooled fighter to be called the
“Lightning,” at a time when the predominance of opinion was against
such craft. Nearby, Dutch Kindleberger of North American, always
crazy like a fox, dreamed up a single-seat liquid-cooled fighter
around the Rolls Royce Merlin engine, a fighter which was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
called the “Mustang,” that would one day become a long-range
escort for bombers over Europe. Down at San Diego, Reuben Fleet
plugged along with flying boats and amphibians, long after the smart
money was all on carrier planes. His Consolidated’s Catalinas would
one day fight the world over for all our allies. And down Baltimore
way the Old Master, Glenn Martin, rode his own hobby of light,
fast bombers for ground attack at the very moment when the “Young
Turks” seemed about to prevail in their battle for heavy bombardment.
Out at Farmingdale, Long Island, the brilliant engineer Kartveli
was forging his Thunderbolts, intended as fighters but destined
for use in the invasion of Europe as the long-range fighter bombers
that broke Hermann Goering’s heart because he was sure we couldn’t
build such planes.</p>

<p>These are but a few of many that come readily to mind. The fact
was, no one could guess whom we would fight, to say nothing of how
or when. Without a foreign policy, we could shape no military
policy, and without a military policy who could guess what airplanes
might be called upon to do? But our saving grace lay in the fact that
this was a free country where any man might risk his money, or even
his neck, in backing his pet idea. When the chips were finally
down, Uncle Sam, who hadn’t killed his air craftsmen with kindness,
found they had supplied him with a wide variety of combat types
from which to choose, a variety that made it possible for him to go
out and win. In a postwar interview, Hermann Goering was reported
to have said that the one thing the Germans had envied us was
our flexible system of individual initiative and enterprise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWENTY-TWO">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO<br>
Review of Some Fundamentals</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">During the protracted period when Hamilton-Standard, Sikorsky,
and Chance Vought found the going rough as they endeavored to
create new products that could be sold to a reluctant government,
Pratt and Whitney for a while made much smoother weather of it.
The Wasp engine had proved so outstanding that no other power
plant had challenged it, and in a field that offered the greatest volume.
Subsequent engines, while not outclassing all competition, as
had the Wasp, won a fair share of the market. As a matter of fact,
it was Pratt and Whitney that had provided most of the resources
out of which the other divisions had prosecuted their new developments.
But now as the year 1937 arrived, even the bellwether of our
flock began to find the pickings scarce.</p>

<p>For certain ones in the Army Air Corps still persisted in advocating
liquid cooling, and now, as they began occupying positions of power,
they pressed harder than ever, this despite the fact that the brilliant
performance of the air-cooled radials had all but driven liquid-cooled
in-line engines out of the country. In England, however, where
the Bristol air-cooled engines had not attained to the same leadership
as had the Pratt and Whitney and Wright radials in America,
Rolls Royce had done an outstanding job with a racing-plane engine
which they had later developed into a fine pursuit engine. In Germany,
where tremendous effort was being made to rehabilitate
aviation after the terms of the Treaty of Versailles had been modified,
Junkers had taken a license to build Pratt and Whitney engines but,
as usual, had not built power plants wholly comparable with the
original. Simultaneously B.M.W. had prosecuted the development
of their own liquid-cooled engines, a type in which they had background
and experience. These facts, plus some new liquid-cooling
developments, had encouraged certain men in the Army to promote
an American liquid-cooled program.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>By using Ethylene Glycol, or Prestone as we know it in our
automobile antifreeze mixtures, many of the difficulties inherent in
liquid-cooling were ameliorated. The new “pressure-cooling” systems
became competitive with the “baffles” of the radials in so far
as weight and performance were concerned; they still retained the
old handicaps of leaky plumbing. In order to exploit this progress,
the Army Engineering Division at Wright Field had designed a
liquid-cooled, in-line engine of its own, and turned over the job of
building and testing it to the Allison Engineering Company, of
Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>

<p>Allison, skilled in automotive experimental work, especially that
associated with racing in the speedway, had built up a fine reputation
by undertaking highly experimental projects that, for one
reason or another, failed to appeal to companies interested in production.
Allison’s president, “Pop” Gilman, had done a lot of Diesel
development, and other clever experimental work for BUAERO
when I was chief of the Engine Section, and he had built up a highly
competent outfit. After completely redesigning the Wright Field
effort, Pop had gone ahead to make a fair engine out of the “Allison.”</p>

<p>In addition to their convictions that the United States should
develop a good liquid-cooled engine, some men in the Air Forces
had always believed that General Motors should become a factor
in engine production. Out of this conviction, the time came when
General Motors absorbed Allison and put its back into power-plant
development. This meant tough competition for the aircraft industry
and while we might, by dint of great effort, keep ourselves
in the forefront of technological progress, we could not, of course,
match the limitless financial resources of “the corporation.” With
the head start we already held in current engine types, we should
more than hold our own, but now with the cold hand of the long
depression pressing down on us, we found the new Army-G.M.
alliance cold comfort indeed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Army continued its pressure on Pratt and Whitney
and Wright Aeronautical, to force both companies to undertake
liquid-cooled engines of their own design. The fact that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
two types would not mix any better than oil and water, and that
for us to divert a portion of our limited energies to something we
did not believe in would impair the development of air cooling,
seemed to have no weight with a few liquid-cooled fanatics.</p>

<p>And now they dug up a new angle. It seemed that out in Santa
Monica, Don Douglas and his engineers were studying a new twin-engined
bomber and were leaning toward the idea that, in order
to reduce the drag and improve the air flow over the wings, the
engines, instead of being mounted outside in the cowls, should be
completely housed in the wings. To meet this requirement, the
engine must be flat, in the form of a pancake. Our own studies contemplated
a twenty-four-cylinder job, and such an arrangement
demanded liquid cooling. Under tremendous pressure from Wright
Field, where, of course, the purse strings were held, Pratt and Whitney
reluctantly agreed to go ahead. Similarly, Wright Aero accepted
the inevitable.</p>

<p>This was the situation in the summer of 1937, when, with Chance
Vought Aircraft just beginning to round out into an effective team,
I was put out of commission by an automobile crack-up that took
me out of active service for several months. Coming home after dark
in a driving rain from a day of trout fishing at the East Haddam
Fish and Game Club, some thirty miles from Hartford, I was
smacked so hard by a speeding motorist that my new convertible
was reduced to a heap of junk. Only through kind providence was
I spared the same fate.</p>

<p>Out of the hospital, I moved from Chance Vought over to the
head office at Pratt and Whitney, to undertake a new program.
Here I set up a small research department and, with a tight little
organization, began collecting all the facts and many fancies, with
a view to shaping a new course.</p>

<p>As the brains of this organization I selected John Lee of Vought.
The designer of the radical SB2U monoplane dive bomber, John had
employed his scientific mind to the company’s great practical advantage.
He would require at least a year to assemble a body of information
that might prove of value in approaching our problem.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
The time had come for someone, free from administrative responsibilities,
to make a considered estimate of the new situation out of
which policy decisions might be reached. Of one thing we were
sure: there is a definite limit to the number of design projects any
one engineering department can handle. The sure way in which to
break down even the best organization is to overload it.</p>

<p>In order to get John Lee and his crew started on their study, I
set for them the task of making a coldblooded analysis of the liquid-cooled
air-cooled controversy. To this end they were to design, from
the ground up, a series of single-seat fighters, each of which was to
utilize each engine to best advantage. We were not interested in
proving a case for either engine, but in ascertaining for ourselves,
without prejudice, which engine was best suited to the job. We
chose the single-seat fighter because this was the type in which the
liquid-cooled appeared to best advantage. John Lee’s job was to
design a whole family of fighters, orthodox or unconventional, and
from this collection make a factual analysis that would resolve our
problem for us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I would make the grand tour of the industry, calling
on everyone who might have an idea or an opinion to contribute to
our study. Out of such a tour we might gather a few valuable ideas,
and hopefully indicate to our customers our own deep interest in
their problems. I would approach the matter with an open mind,
collect detailed notes of my interviews, and assemble them in such
form as would best indicate the thinking of the whole industry on
our problem.</p>

<p>And so, while John Lee assembled a handful of selected assistants,
I set out on my tour. At Bethpage, Long Island, I interviewed Roy
Grumman and Jake Schwoble and visited their shops. Roy, the
president of the company, was also its leading engineer—then a
rather common situation in aviation—while Jake, a hard-hitting
shopman, was more or less the business manager. Here was a competent
pair surrounded by an able team, doing a smart job, as we in
Vought so well knew through competing with them.</p>

<p>At Seversky’s (now Republic’s) plant at Farmingdale, Long Island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
I was impressed by the sharp contrast between the two Russians,
Seversky and Sikorsky. Both were White Russian refugees,
both had left their native land, where they were no longer welcome
even to live, much less create airplanes, and both had found in free
America a climate under which they could employ their talents.
Alex P. de Seversky, ably supported by clever engineers led by
Kartveli, was a power in the fighter field and, as an ardent advocate
of air-cooled engines, had backed Pratt and Whitney exclusively.</p>

<p>On arrival at the Naval Aircraft Factory, Philadelphia, I found
many old friends and associates of my days in BUAERO. The factory,
in compliance with some legislation that required them to
produce a certain percentage of all production, as a so-called “yardstick
to private industry,” had undertaken to manufacture Wright
Whirlwind engines under license. The management had little sympathy
with the idea—any such yardstick must be a rubber one—and
what with interferences by local politicos and the usual complications
inherent in government manufacture, the project had bogged
down.</p>

<p>At Glenn L. Martin’s plant down near Baltimore, I had a good
visit with the old-timer sometimes described as “the dean of the
airplane industry.” A conservative when it came to design, Glenn had
pioneered in volume production processes, and on the financial side
had taken numerous risks that proved intelligent. And for all his
ups and downs, he had lost none of his zeal for commercial aviation,
even though he had lost his shirt as had Sikorsky and Boeing, building
Clippers for Pan American Airways.</p>

<p>A visit to BUAERO brought recollections of exciting days under
Admiral Moffett and emphasized his inimitable qualities. By now the
Engine Section, having lost its sense of direction, had begun to waver
in the air-cooled versus liquid-cooled conflict, and no longer wielded
its old influence.</p>

<p>From Washington’s hazy atmosphere I moved out to the clearer
skies of the Pacific Northwest. At Boeing, Claire Egtvedt, though
reduced by indifferent health to acting in an advisory capacity, still
kept his unimpaired view of the fundamentals of aviation. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
orderly, considered estimate of the engine problem was more than
worth the trip west; besides, it was stimulating to yarn about the
good old days.</p>

<p>Phil Johnson’s departure from Boeing had left a big vacuum. Having
been banished from the American transport scene, he had undertaken
to create his newest masterpiece, Trans-Canada Airlines. Phil
had once told me a story about how he had got his first job with
Boeing. While still a student in aeronautics at the University of
Washington, he had chanced to be alone in the office of the head of
the department at the moment when Bill Boeing had called on the
telephone to inquire the name of a likely student to fill a job in his
new factory. Phil, answering the ring, had promptly replied, “P. G.
Johnson!”</p>

<p>Proud of his Scandinavian origin, he delighted in springing a pet
question, “What is dumber than a dumb Swede?” His answer, “A
smart Irishman.”</p>

<p>Down in Los Angeles, where a big segment of the airplane business,
attracted by the physical and economic climate, had set up
shop, I found Don Douglas at his old stand in Santa Monica, Dutch
Kindleberger in a new shop at Inglewood, Jack Northrup in a new
establishment at Hawthorne, and Bob Gross at our old flying field
at Burbank. These men, though competitive and individualistic, and
as different one from the other as night from day, were all animated
by the same enthusiasm for aviation and zeal for its advancement.</p>

<p>Don Douglas, conservative as to design, skillful in production,
long on timing, and alert as to customer service, had done one of
aviation’s outstanding jobs. His company, like the others, remained
pretty much a one-man show, managed by engineers with good
judgment and a limitless capacity for work. Don’s was a well-balanced
show, founded on sound character, far-sighted vision, and
Scotch thrift.</p>

<p>“Dutch” Kindleberger, of North American, a journeyman engineer
specializing in military aircraft, delighted in personally contriving
ingenious labor-saving devices. A salty citizen, he once
summed up the case for the airplane, “There never has been an airplane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
designed and built that wasn’t full of bugs. And you can’t
delouse an airplane with insecticide. Instead you pick them out the
hard way, like hunting fleas on a woolly dog, and when you finally
get the one that is making his nose twitch, it is probably biting him
under the tail!”</p>

<p>“Dutch,” to my shocked surprise, had shifted his allegiance to
liquid-cooled engines and was even then mocking up a new power
plant installation that threatened serious competition for Pratt and
Whitney. However, I remembered that Dutch knew how to give a
customer what he wanted, and the Army was his principal customer.</p>

<p>Bob Gross, who had bought Lockheed for a song, had succeeded
in giving Don Douglas real competition in air transports. While
tending to depreciate his own efforts, he managed an aggressive
outfit that placed a high premium on speed. Jack Northrup, having
launched a new company, was bubbling with enthusiasm for his
newest project, a big bomber designed along the lines of his earlier
flying-wing. Always unorthodox, yet extremely practical, he was
most helpful to me with my problem.</p>

<p>Following my Los Angeles visit, I flew down to San Diego to
look up Reuben Fleet of Consolidated Aircraft, an enterpriser who
had lost none of his enthusiasm for, and skill at, making an honest
dollar. By this time the Navy had become San Diego’s major industry
and FLEET AIR filled the skies with formations of carrier
aircraft.</p>

<p>Out of this tour around the country, I not only collected every
man’s point of view as to power plants, but got an interesting cross-section
of the industry as a whole. One-man shows for the most part,
they were managed by engineer executives, a combination hard to
beat when manufacturing was involved. In contrast with the rather
studied approach we had in United, they were bold and forthright.
Averaging then somewhat under forty-five years of age, they compressed
into brief business careers the whole history of aviation.</p>

<p>In a brief span of two decades, they had created a whole new
technology, and this had been accomplished in the face of many
vicissitudes. Through doing business largely with a few customers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
like the government or the airlines, they had developed an outlook
quite at variance with that of industries dealing with large numbers
of individual customers. As an important segment of the national
security, it was natural that they should look upon their profession
more as a public service, and thus develop an appreciation of public
relations. At a time when new enterprises had been almost interdicted
by the unfavorable economic climate and they had been
singled out for attack, they had still gone on, with youthful self-reliance,
with rugged independence, and a competitive spirit, to
exploit the freedom of their homeland and create a new art.</p>

<p>And out of my swing around the circuit, I reached clear conclusions
with respect to my own problem, aircraft power plants. I had
heard nothing to shake my convictions as to the superiority of air-cooled
radials. On the contrary, I had heard much to confirm them.
If the Air Corps still wanted a source of supply for liquid-cooled
engines, they should look elsewhere than Hartford. Furthermore,
even if Pratt and Whitney could create the world’s best liquid-cooled
engine as well as the best air-cooled, it would do little good.
The two required different tools, different production processes, in
fact separate factories, and we already had our hands full with our
own job.</p>

<p>This added up to the fact that in trying to do both jobs we were
compromising our ability to discharge our responsibility with
respect to air-cooling. We must get back on the beam at the first
favorable opportunity and devote our resources to continuing to
build the best air-cooled engines in the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWENTY-THREE">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE<br>
A Yankee Peddler</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">In the spring of 1938, Tom Hamilton, our United Aircraft representative
in Europe, came home on one of his periodic visits, to bring
himself up to date on new products and to let us in on the low-down
in his territory. Ordinarily a buoyant optimist, Tom was much depressed
by the developments in Germany. Adolf Hitler had got him
down.</p>

<p>Tom had first taken over the European territory at my suggestion
back in the early ’thirties. His aviation interests had always been
predominantly commercial. While he had built propellers for both
Army and Navy at his Hamilton Aero Manufacturing Company,
in Milwaukee, he had built only commercial aircraft at his other
establishment, the Hamilton Metalplane Company, of the same
place. His “Hamilton Metalplane,” a high-wing metal monoplane
with a single Pratt and Whitney Hornet engine, had been used extensively
by Canadian bush flyers and The Isthmian Airways had
operated them with signal success across the Isthmus of Panama.
This plane, according to Tom, had been the prototype from which
the Ford Trimotor had evolved.</p>

<p>At the time Tom had first gone abroad there appeared little likelihood
of any real business for United in Europe. European aircraft
were considered by Europeans to be vastly superior to the American,
and their strong nationalism caused them to prefer to buy at
home in support of their own industries. But there was one item in
which we had attained leadership—metal aircraft propellers—and
even though we might not sell the articles themselves, I thought we
might dispose of the right to manufacture under our foreign patents
for a good price. The money would come in handy in the development
of the controllable-pitch propeller.</p>

<p>Tom had therefore gone abroad as a direct representative of the
three companies under my management, Hamilton-Standard, Sikorsky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
Aviation, and Chance Vought Aircraft. Vought, of course,
had nothing to offer at the moment. Upon arrival in Europe, Tom
set up headquarters in Paris and laid the groundwork for his business.
As a Yankee peddler, Tom displayed all the initiative and enterprise
that characterized the American in a foreign land, but combined
it with a rare knack of adapting himself to the customs of the
country. In character and outward appearance he became quite continental.
He set himself up in the George V Hotel in Paris, showed
an aptitude for meeting and impressing the right people, and gave
to his business entertainment the personal touch of a naturally warm-hearted
individual. He exuded the confidence in American products
that derived from deep conviction born of intimate knowledge of
aircraft production and aeronautical engineering, and undertook the
apparently hopeless task of penetrating the European market because
he was certain that American production techniques could
compete against European cheap hand labor. He had seen the automotive
industry succeed in penetrating foreign trade barriers to the
benefit of both American industry and American labor, and was
confident American aviation could duplicate the feat.</p>

<p>He had not done too well with our propeller license—it took
Raycroft Walsh and the controllable-pitch propeller to turn that
trick—and when Fred Rentschler visited Europe after a year or
so, Tom had to put on his best selling vest to keep Fred from closing
out the office. Tom finally won out by suggesting that he give up
his salary and continue on a commission basis.</p>

<p>In the interim between the long Armistice and Hitler’s renewal
of the World War, commercial air transport flourished on the Continent.
International competition was reminiscent of the earlier
struggle for control of the sea; one nation relied on private initiative,
the other sought to capitalize air commerce through government
ownership. Earlier in the struggle for sea power, Britain
had defeated France through private enterprise. France, under the
brilliant Colbert, had staked everything on government support of
monopolistic trade associations or guilds. When, finally, Colbert had
called in the industrialists to ask what more he might do to help them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
they had responded in unison, “<em>Laissez nous faire!</em>” (Leave us alone).</p>

<p>But now Britain, having concentrated authority over civil air
transport in a separate ministry wholly dominated by an air force
steeped in the Douhet doctrine, had abandoned private enterprise,
and, following the drift toward state ownership, had put commercial
aviation under government control. The effect of this had been
clearly set forth in the so-called “Cadman Report,” the Report of
the British Committee of Inquiry into Civil Aviation, published in
March, 1938, which stated unequivocally that, except on Empire
routes, that country was backward in civil air transport.</p>

<p>This statement, of course, took cognizance of the rapid progress
in America where, following the development of the air-cooled
engine, the controllable-pitch propeller, the Boeing and Douglas
transports, the Sikorsky boats, and Lindbergh’s epic flight, commercial
aviation had flourished. These products now became Tom
Hamilton’s stock in trade and he peddled them most successfully
to independent customers whose decisions were dictated by economic
considerations rather than those of national prestige.</p>

<p>When Tom visited Hartford, we often gathered at the close of a
business day before the fireplace in our basement recreation room.
Its walls were hung with Indian curios and colored prints of Indian
warriors, while the corner posts of the fireplace nook boasted accurate
replicas of Alaskan totem poles carved under Tom’s supervision
and decorated by him. Both of us having been raised in the Pacific
Northwest, at a time when pioneers still lived to recount tales of
their many enterprises, we had absorbed some of their spirit.</p>

<p>The curious turn of events in England, where the most enterprising
nation of modern times seemed to have fallen on evil days, came
in for much discussion. Tom had accumulated a number of ideas
while traveling abroad. For one thing, England, having acquired
great wealth, seemed bent on holding onto it, preferably without
having to work. Her desire for economic security reflected a human
trait that accompanies maturity. Her government, always responsive
to business influence, had gradually abandoned free trade in exchange
for monopolies and cartels. Meanwhile business had exploited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
labor as a commodity, a fact disclosed by the character of
her industrial cities. The High Street led upwind by way of wide
avenues to cultivated gardens; the crooked lane to the workers’
cottages wound past bleak habitations blackened by factory smoke.
Ultimately, labor in revolt had replaced the business monopoly
with one of its own. Labor leaders, having acquired power, became
its prisoners. Unless they wielded their power for the material
benefit of the workers they represented, someone else would either
force them to action or grab their jobs. In time these labor monopolists
would feel the force of government in the form of a dictatorship
or government monopoly. With the nationalization of industry,
initiative and enterprise were sure to be stifled; all incentive would be
lost. Tom had witnessed this in France without dreaming it could
spread to England. With the vital spark extinguished, the body
politic must decay. It always had. Yet while watching the creeping
paralysis in England, Tom observed that certain nations continued
to exercise their initiative.</p>

<p>In Holland, for instance, where the Dutch, though defeated by
the English fleet, had gone on to expand ocean commerce to create
an empire in the Indies, the perception of their statesmen and merchants
had suffered no obscuration. As far back as October 7, 1918,
a month before the Armistice, the Dutch had pioneered with what
was to become the world-famous K.L.M. and K.N.I.L.M., outstanding
services on the continent of Europe extending to the Dutch East
and West Indies. The Scandinavian countries, which behind the
sure shield of the Grand Fleet had expanded their sea power, now
linked their homeland with the rest of the Continent and with London,
and made plans for their forthcoming service to the Americas.
In Norway, Bernt Balchen, the well-known explorer, tied the
efforts in with American products; in Sweden, Aktiebolaget Aerotransport
standardized on American aircraft like the Douglas DC-3.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Belgians, always an enterprising people, covered
Europe and reached out for the Congo with their “Sabena.” In
Italy, the tendency was to use domestic types like the Savoia-Marchettis,
but the Italians purchased technical information and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
licenses to build American products. In Poland, the Polish Airlines
“LOT” operated an extensive service using American equipment.
A Jugoslav service covered the capitals of Europe. Finland connected
Helsinki with Berlin.</p>

<p>The Germans, after getting the restrictions of the Versailles
Treaty lifted, moved rapidly to make up lost ground. Junkers began
to manufacture its version of the Boeing 247, and Bavarian
Motoren Werke, builders of one of the best in-line liquid-cooled
engines extant, took a license to manufacture the Pratt and Whitney
Hornet. Junkers took a license to manufacture the Hamilton-Standard
propeller, but later abandoned it in favor of their own “V.D.M.”
The German Lufthansa, equipped with aircraft derived from the
American technologies, spread over Europe and reached out to
the far comers of the world, like South America.</p>

<p>In France, which we now recognize as a casualty of World War I,
the world’s strongest air force was dissipated by storing war surplus
aircraft and neglecting a living industry. In fact, the French industry,
suffering from subversive activities, declined to the point where
the government could conveniently nationalize it and, to all intents
and purposes, strangle it. French air transport suffered from the
internal dissensions which were rife at the time, but Air France attempted
to write its name in history with aircraft predominantly of
American conception.</p>

<p>In England, even the Empire routes suffered in competition with
American aircraft. Thus when Pan American was ready to initiate
the Bermuda-Azores-Lisbon transatlantic service, with the new
Sikorsky S-42 Clippers, the British delayed granting landing rights
in Bermuda to Pan American until they could build a plane of their
own, undertaken after Mr. Sikorsky had read a paper before the
Royal Aeronautical Society outlining the novel features in his design
and setting down its measured performance. During this delay,
Pan American shifted its attention to the far Pacific and, using
the same Sikorsky Clippers, pioneered the air route to Hawaii and
the Orient.</p>

<p>The activity associated with the growth of world air transport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
provided Tom with just the opportunity he had foreseen. Furthermore,
after the American air-mail contracts had been canceled and
the American long-term program had broken down, the business
Tom had brought to United enabled us to keep our heads above
water. Revenue from the sale of technical information provided
us with funds with which to keep in the forefront of technological
progress. And though we did not realize it, that morning when Tom
came home from Europe, his efforts would later provide the
sustenance which would save Pratt and Whitney and its organization
for a decisive contribution to the coming World War II. It was
the war clouds from the cold front in Europe that depressed Tom’s
buoyant spirit.</p>

<p>“This man Hitler,” he said, “is the world’s evil genius.” We were
sitting in my office in East Hartford trying to plan our moves in a
game of blind-man’s buff.</p>

<p>“You people over here,” Tom went on, “tend to discount him
because he wears a Charlie Chaplin moustache. But, believe me, he
is no tramp. He knows Germans like a book and gives them just the
sort of leadership they eat up. It reminds you of the old picture of
the donkey with a carrot in front of him and a lash behind him.
Hitler knows how to hold out the carrot with one hand and pop the
whip with the other.”</p>

<p>Tom went on to muse about the curious way thoughts took wing.
Here was a former corporal of the Landswehr who had dreamed
up a screwy idea and by force of his own conviction had sold it
to the German people. Similarly, Lenin had generated an idea and,
through sheer fanaticism, had come up from the dregs to impose
a new tyranny on a people who had never known much else.
Worse still, the cockeyed idea had spread into other lands in the
short two decades since the Armistice from a war to make the world
safe from such things. In Italy, it was Mussolini; in Japan, Hirohito.
Here were four men on horseback, the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse, and no one was doing anything about a counterattack
with a better idea. One was ready at hand in the Christian faith, but
subversive influences had persuaded Christians that it was unsophisticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
even to talk about it. Protestants were so busy attacking
Catholics that they were unwittingly led into an attitude toward
communism which, if not sympathy, is at least not outspoken opposition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at home we buried our heads in the sand. Unable to
conceive such an idea as attacking others, we persuaded ourselves
that some miracle would protect us. Our only means of counterattack
was to pass a law against war and the current nostrum went
under the title of “Arms Embargo Act.” It had its origin in the
ancient myth of the war profiteer, an old wives’ tale founded on
the idea that greedy munition racketeers in search of profits had
fomented World War I. Its approach to keeping the peace was to
prohibit the sale of arms to all belligerents. But, as Tom pointed out,
it wouldn’t work out that way.</p>

<p>To date it had served as a good excuse for French bureaucrats to
oppose the purchase of arms in the United States, on the grounds
that delivery could be cut off by Hitler; all that was necessary was
to declare war on France and convert her into a belligerent. The
Act thus became an invitation to Hitler to make war whenever it
suited his convenience. The Germans and Italians needed no American
help; they had made themselves self-sufficient. From the moment
the air-mail cancellations had thrown a rough lock on our own
aviation program, they had seized upon the opportunity to expand
their own air power as a new weapon with which the have nots
could take what they wanted from the haves. Hitler had made no
bones about it; such Nazis as Goering, Milch, and Udet bragged
about their prowess to every American who visited Germany.</p>

<p>Among these, Charles A. Lindbergh had sought to sound a note
of warning when he said to a Nazi assembly in Flyers-House in Berlin
in July, 1936,</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Unlike the builder of the dugout canoe, we have lived to
see our harmless wings of fabric turned into carriers of destruction
even more dangerous than battleships and guns. We
have lived to carry on our shoulders the responsibility for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
results of our experiments which, in other fields, have passed
to future generations.</p>

<p>We in aviation carry a heavy responsibility on our shoulders,
for while we have been drawing the world closer together in
peace, we have stripped the armor of every nation in war. It
is no longer possible to defend the heart of a country with its
army. Armies can no more stop an air attack than a suit of mail
can stop a rifle bullet. Aviation has, I believe, created the most
fundamental changes ever made in war. It has turned defense
into attack. We can no longer protect our families with an
army. Our libraries, our museums—every institution which we
value most, is laid bare to bombardment.</p>

<p>Aviation has brought a revolutionary change to a world already
staggering from changes. It is our responsibility to make
sure that doing so, we do not destroy the very things we wish
to protect.</p>
</div>

<p>Reports as to German preparations by Lindbergh and numerous
other competent observers had been discounted at home. A naval
air attaché at Berlin had been threatened with orders home and
accused of being pro-Nazi because he had made a factual report of
German preparations. And at the very moment when Tom could
arouse no interest in France or England looking to utilization of
American products, the Italians, the Germans, the Japanese, and
the Russians had come knocking at his door. At the time it was difficult
to be selective. As the Four Horsemen jockeyed for advantage
in the race for world dominion, no one knew who would be on our
side. As it ultimately turned out, all four were against us at one
time, what with the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis supported by the Russian
nonaggression pact. But United Aircraft did draw the line in
one situation; we quoted such high prices for our technical assistance
that the Russians refused to buy from us. We knew, of course, that
this did not prevent their getting whatever they wanted but at least
we kept them out of our plants.</p>

<p>Tom, having long resided in France, had a strong attachment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to the country and its people. Now with Hitler arming, he redoubled
his efforts to interest the French Air Ministry in an arrangement
which would place our facilities at their command in the
emergency. After much delay he had finally succeeded in persuading
them to test our engines in their laboratories with a view to
“homologuing” them and clearing the way for later purchase, if
desired. The engines had met all demands and had even got by
in spite of some sand and glass which somehow always tended to get
into the test engines.</p>

<p>Moving as Tom did in military and diplomatic circles, he had
acquired an unusual outlook on the European situation. Yet he had
not, as yet, been able to forecast the final line-up. Nazism and communism,
though similar under the skin, were natural enemies. If
British diplomacy, bent on maintaining the old balance of power on
the Continent, could involve Russia and Germany, she might win a
respite for western Europe. But if Russian diplomacy could bring
Moscow into the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis, at least temporarily,
Hitler would have a free hand with western Europe—where fifth
columns had already penetrated—and might dominate British sea
power with an air force based on shore and operating from interior
lines. Meanwhile our natural friends abroad scorned our products
even as our enemies scrambled to buy our technology.</p>

<p>And so the Yankee Peddler who had set out to advance the new
art of air transport, and in so doing expand world trade and promote
prosperity, suddenly found himself in the cloak-and-dagger
business. The war, he knew, would set air transport back at least
ten years to say nothing of incalculable damage in every other
aspect of life. We were caught in a net spun out of the idea first
suggested by General Jiulio Douhet and later endorsed by other
fanatics. And all the while the biggest idea in human existence, the
doctrine according to Jesus Christ, lay fallow for lack of ardent
advocates.</p>

A Chill Sets In</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Don Brown, our president, who had been in ill health for some
time, was now unable to give personal attention to the multitude
of matters, and it fell to me to try to get some coordinated action on
industry problems. Any sort of joint action by our Aeronautical
Chamber of Commerce had long ago been proved impossible, first
because joint action called for unanimous consent and no two of
our bully boys in the industry could agree on anything. Of course
on rare occasions we reached an agreement, and such an occasion
developed one day in the office of the Assistant Secretary of War.</p>

<p>Out of the confusion and extravagance incident to the last war,
Congress had passed the Army Reorganization Act of 1921, under
which responsibility for production planning and mobilization had
been lodged in the Assistant Secretary of War. That office had been
collecting an array of card indexes which purported to assign some
sort of role for mobilization to each manufacturer. After some
twenty years of this, the Assistant Secretary, then Mr. Louis Johnson,
having decided to take a look at his handiwork, had summoned
the aircraft industry. The conference was called to order by General
Westover, then Chief of the Air Corps, who was supported by
“Hap” Arnold, Assistant Chief, and by Colonel Burns, from the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of War.</p>

<p>General Westover stated the situation: the Army would like to
have our estimate of the effectiveness of their war plans effort. If,
after looking the situation over, we gave general approval, they
would ask us to remain over another day to suggest improvements.
They wanted our frank opinion of progress. General Westover then
introduced General Arnold, who conducted the inquiry.</p>

<p>Hap Arnold was a favorite with the industry. Forthright, courageous,
and decisive, he had supported Billy Mitchell at a time when
less able men would have taken the easier course. Along with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
handful of similarly able men like Hugh Knerr, a classmate of mine
and rifle teammate who had transferred to the Army, Louis Brereton,
also a Naval Academy graduate, Frank Andrews, Carl Spaatz,
Jimmy Doolittle, and others, Hap had preached the air-force doctrine
in fair and foul weather. Now he grinned at us across the
table.</p>

<p>“Well,” he inquired, “who wants to drop the opening bomb?”
From the back of the room the salty voice of Dutch Kindleberger
resounded.</p>

<p>“If you ask me,” he volunteered, “I think you’ve had twenty
years of hogwash.” There was a murmur of surprise.</p>

<p>“From time to time,” Dutch went on, “you send your bright young
men to ask us the same question: ‘how many airplanes can you
manufacture X days after M Day?’ And when I counter that question
with another—‘what kind of airplanes?’—your young men
don’t have the answer.” As Dutch finished, Glenn Martin put in
his oar.</p>

<p>“I agree with Dutch,” he began, as a titter greeted the idea that
these two might agree on anything.</p>

<p>“You expect us to give you a war plan,” Glenn went on, “before
you have answered the question; and furthermore, you expect us
to give you something worthwhile at no cost. According to my
estimate,” Glenn continued, “it would cost at least ten thousand dollars
for us to get up anything useful, and you apparently expect us
to advance it out of profits. It can’t be done.” As Glenn finished,
Hap glanced my way.</p>

<p>My experience with Army was more limited than that of the
others. In Hamilton-Standard, Ray Walsh had handled Army business.
In Sikorsky and Vought, the dealings had been mostly with
Navy. In Pratt and Whitney, “Tilly” Tillinghast, himself a former
Army pilot and a favorite with all, had handled Army contacts.
However, there were some fundamentals that seemed to apply to
both.</p>

<p>“I agree with Dutch and Glenn,” I began, adding to the unusual
flurry of interindustry agreement, “and I’ll go a step farther. For a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
real test of your war plan, I suggest that you start a staff exercise
on mobilization and watch what happens.” Hap Arnold flashed me
that quizzical Army expression that wonders how any good could
come out of the Navy. I went on to explain.</p>

<p>My own experience in naval operations had shown me that in a
dress rehearsal it is seldom the high private in the rear rank who falls
down. More likely, it’s the green second lieutenant in the file closers
who gets tangled up in his sword. He’s been so busy drilling others,
he’s forgotten to read his own book. You have to put machinery
into operation to find out where it creaks the loudest. In this case,
if the Secretaries of War and Navy would order mobilization for
drill purposes by designating a certain day as M Day, Headquarters
could then announce the types of airplanes it wanted to put into
production and the number of each it required, and then procurement
officers could go ahead with drill purchase orders, and the
contractors could place orders to suppliers, and so on. About here
I noticed a flicker in Hap’s steely eye.</p>

<p>“I guess Dutch and Glenn are right,” he said with a wry grin.
“Hell,” he went on, “I can’t begin to tell you today what airplanes
we would want to buy, let alone how many. I don’t even know who
we expect to fight, nor when, nor where.”</p>

<p>From here on the conference moved rapidly to the crystallization
of an idea. Since time is of the essence in mobilization, one way to
save time was to build the mobilization plan into current purchasing.
When the government placed an order for a certain type of equipment,
it could include in the original contract an item calling out a
detailed war plan to be paid for under the contract. Such a war plan
would include options for war quantities and the contractor would
place stand-by orders with his own suppliers for the amounts of
materials of all kinds required to fill the options. He and his suppliers
would go ahead with architects’ plans, drawings, and all other
paper work incident to creating the expanded facilities required by
the options, the idea being to get all contract paper work done, even
to the determination of critical materials and priorities. Then, upon
a signal of execution designating an option, the machine could start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
operating, without all the preliminary delays, and still leave the procurement
agency free to make its decisions at the last minute.</p>

<p>Hap Arnold listened to the discussion. “Well,” he remarked, “I
see we won’t need that second day for this conference.” With that
he called in General Westover and Colonel Burns, to whom the
general plan was explained. General Westover closed the conference
with the statement that he intended to get some such plan in operation,
if it was the last thing he did.</p>

<p>But of course, with things as they were, neither he nor anyone
else could put such an idea into operation. With the outbreak of the
war, responsibility for mobilization was shifted out of the Assistant
Secretary’s office and into a new and independent agency, which
started as the National Defense Advisory Committee and changed
its name, at intervals, to the end of the emergency.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when I got back to Hartford and reported the experience
to Don Brown, Don sat a long while looking out the window,
across acres that had once been peaceful tobacco fields.</p>

<p>“Well, Skipper,” he said finally, “it looks as though you had sold
United Aircraft something, whether the Army buys it or not. We’ll
start building our own war-plans organization and get it ready for
trouble.” After our estimates of the cost of such a program had come
in, we discovered that they totaled just $10,000 per year, the figure
Glenn Martin had mentioned down in Washington, but, like Glenn,
we had no idea where the money was to come from.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the gradual drying up of government business
and with a view to trying to get funds from Congress to help tide
us over slack periods, Don Brown had outlined his situation to
BUAERO and the Army Air Corps. As a result of efforts by the
Armed Forces, Congress had appropriated funds for new engines
to be ordered from Pratt and Whitney. It had seemed to us at the
time that, with war imminent, the administration might have made
better use of relief funds than raking leaves. As a matter of fact, a
good deal of relief money was being invested in air fields and armament,
but the program was not coordinated; Mr. Ickes and Mr.
Hopkins differed as to who was boss. The idea prevailed that peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
could be had by just wishing for it. To have spent money for arms,
or even to have directed it into the business stream so as to keep the
production machine at a high level, would, at that time, have been
considered unmoral. On the other hand, spending money wastefully
for made work seemed to meet with public approval. The
bald fact remained, however, that with war but a few months away,
Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, one of the two dependable sources of
proved aircraft engines, faced a shutdown, and with it, dispersal of
an organization which could never have been reassembled.</p>

<p>To our relief, however, Congress appropriated funds, and the
Army notified Pratt and Whitney that it might proceed with the
procurement of materials and the production of engines in advance
of the formal contract, with the idea of utilizing the allotment to
best advantage from the point of view of readiness for emergency.
Then, sometime after we had swung into our program, the Air
Corps, to our amazement, canceled this informal assurance, and
diverted the funds to the procurement of Allison liquid-cooled
engines. At that time the General Motors Corporation, owners of
Allison, had indicated little need for public relief funds, but to Pratt
and Whitney, now almost wholly dependent upon government business,
the loss of this critical order was a body blow.</p>

<p>When, later, Don called upon the Assistant Secretary of War,
Mr. Louis Johnson, to point out to him the results of his decision,
he was advised that the Army had decided to scrap all air-cooled
engines in pursuit planes. Next year would probably see the last
of air-cooled engines in bombers. He was instructed to start Pratt
and Whitney designing liquid-cooled engines at once. To Don,
knowing that Allison, equally surprised by the decision, had not yet
started tooling, while Pratt and Whitney, already tooled, must
remain idle, the decision hardly made sense.</p>

<p>Somewhat bewildered by the change, Don then called on Hap
Arnold. Here he learned that the secretary’s decision had also taken
the Air Force by surprise. Anxious to keep Allison ticking over,
Wright Field had built up such a strong case for liquid-cooled, that
the secretary had decided to scrap air-cooled. Since recent pursuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
planes like the Seversky had been designed for air-cooled, the decision
had left them on a spot. Apparently, however, the decision once
taken could not be recalled. No one in the Air Force had dreamed
for a moment that it would be taken, but here we were, out on a
long limb, and war was in the offing.</p>

<p>As the year 1938 came to a close, we began laying off men, dropping
first those who could be the more readily spared. But the time
came when the organization was being seriously hurt, and the year-end
forecast indicated that, by July, 1939, we would reach the end
of our production. Since materials must be in hand five to six months
ahead of delivery of the finished article, that meant that time had
already begun to run out for Pratt and Whitney. We had long
since cut back expenses to the bare minimum and there remained
nothing but a final decision to suspend manufacturing operations.
Yet even then, Don Brown kept the War Plans Division intact.</p>

<p>Now we had but a single remaining hope: Tom Hamilton in Paris.
Tom reported by radiotelephone that the French, now reduced to
dire straights, still vacillated, but had established financial credits in
the United States and would send a purchasing commission to
Washington to open negotiations direct with us. Don Brown, sick
as he was, went down to Washington with some of our staff to
battle through hours of legalistic verbiage, in smoke-filled rooms
of Washington hotels.</p>

<p>Here it developed that the United States Treasury would act as
a sort of intermediary between the French commission and the
American manufacturers, and that Secretary Henry Morgenthau
had turned the job over to Capt. Harry Collins, then head of the
Purchasing Division of the Treasury. With the Arms Embargo Act
still adorning the legislative library, active participation by the
Treasury in negotiations between United States arms manufacturers
and a possible “belligerent” had certain aspects of incongruity.
However, the whole situation was so phony that this detail escaped
public attention.</p>

<p>Capt. Harry Collins provided just the <em>savoir faire</em> necessary to
resolve an impossible situation into a completed contract. Harry had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
served as supply officer on the ancient destroyer-tender <em>Iris</em> back
in the dark ages when I had commanded the four-piper <em>Truxtun</em>,
then based on San Diego. He had resigned his commission to go into
business and had there shown the same tact that had endeared him
to the temperamental skippers of the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla.</p>

<p>Throughout the negotiations, Don Brown stood fast on the principle
that prices to be paid for the equipment should be high enough
to permit us to take the necessary financial risks required by the early
deliveries specified. The customer should not hamstring us by chiseling
prices to the point where our willingness to accept risks was
impaired. Fortunately the soundness of this position was apparent
to Harry, and his confidence in us enabled him to support it in the
discussions with Col. Paul Jacquin of the French commission. The
colonel proved to be a man of high character with a sense of fairness
and a degree of integrity that finally brought the negotiations to a
satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>The contract was signed on February 14, 1939, at almost the
precise moment when further delay would have done us irreparable
harm. As a matter of fact, the time had long passed when a garrison
finish might be of any help to France; the chief benefit of this contract
lay in the fact that it gave the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft
organization a shot in the arm, and put us in such position that when,
two years later, the Japs smacked us at Pearl Harbor, we could swing
into full-scale production for the American account.</p>

<p>After Don Brown’s return to Hartford, his health forced him to
turn more and more of his work over to me. In this I functioned,
much as I had once done for Admiral Reeves, as a sort of chief of
staff, seeking to do things in the way Don himself would have done
them, had he been personally on the firing line. Somewhat earlier,
when our difficulties had become serious, I urged Don to invite Fred
Rentschler to return to our board as chairman where we could call
on him for advice and get the benefit of his judgment. Now we three
began working closely together—at least as closely as Don’s declining
health permitted.</p>

<p>Don, a singularly attractive and lovable person, having come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
upstairs by way of the shop, always displayed a strong sense of
responsibility for his men. The specter of shutdown weighed heavily
on him and now, as the illness that was to prove fatal began closing
in on him, his thoughts were still down on the factory floor.</p>

<p>One day he and I walked along an aisle between the machines. Don
made some remark to the effect that he longed to be back there
where the problems were of the kind a man could get his teeth into.
Behind us we heard the voice of a young kid making some crack
about how soft it was for guys that did nothing but sit on cushions
in paneled offices and look wise. Don turned and brushed the kid
away from the machine. After running it awhile in obvious enjoyment,
he turned to the workman:</p>

<p>“Listen, son,” he said, not unkindly, “I’d trade jobs with you any
day if I could, but you wouldn’t take the responsibility. That’s something
you fellows never want to accept.”</p>

<p>Toward midsummer, we began to hear rumors that the French
needed more equipment than our humming plant could deliver.
By this time Secretary Johnson’s action had reacted to our advantage.
The inventory of raw stock, semifinished, and finished parts
which they had left on our hands when they canceled our order
enabled us to get rolling without the protracted delay which would
have been inevitable had our pipe lines been drained before the big
freeze. And so, almost overnight, we had the machines humming
again and the empty parking spaces around the plant filled up with
cars. But this rumor of new plants was a horse of another color.</p>

<p>First of all, we had no capital with which to construct a new addition,
nor did it seem likely we could get it had we wanted it—which
we didn’t. Having faced the cold shadows of a vacant factory, we
had no appetite for more of the same. The punitive attitude of our
own government had completely dammed up all sources of private
capital for expansion of munitions plants. Actually, the long depression
had all but dried up investment in any private venture. The
fear and uncertainty which had cast such a pall over the land had been
intensified by the drift toward government domination of business
and the rise of bureaucratic dictation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Among other things, there was the sensitive factor of profit control.
For instance, the Internal Revenue Bureau of Mr. Henry
Morgenthau’s Treasury Department dictated, through its review of
income tax returns and its rules and regulations, the amount a manufacturer
might charge against the cost of his product for the use
of his tools. The manufacturer, having in mind the many elements
of this problem, such as the wear and tear on machines, the life
cycle of the product he was selling, and many other complex factors,
would charge against each item of manufacture what he judged
to be its proper share of the cost of the tools. The more he charged,
the less was his profit for a given year. In the long run the whole thing
washed out. But the Internal Revenue Bureau, sitting in judgment
of each case and anxious to prove high profit in order to assess higher
taxes, was interested in reducing this depreciation charge as far as
possible. Bearing no responsibility for the survival of a company,
and having little knowledge of, or interest in, the technical details
of the manufacturer’s problem, it tended to set up over-all rules
which, even though applicable to one case, might be far out of line
for another. And since munitions manufacturers were generally unpopular,
they had two strikes on them from the beginning. Real
investors, understanding this handicap, were not interested in risking
their dollars on this kind of enterprise, nor were the enterprises
interested in seeking their money.</p>

<p>Now, if the public policies of the period dried up the flow of
capital to private industry, or even reduced it to a trickle, the Arms
Embargo Act put the finishing touches upon the process. All Chancellor
Hitler had to do to make a “belligerent” out of France was to
open war on France, and since the French were now buying aircraft
in the United States, the sooner he did the better. On September
1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland; on September 5, France declared
war on Germany. President Roosevelt immediately issued his proclamation
of neutrality, thus putting the Act into effect and cutting
off shipments to belligerents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the frantic French, desperate by now, had,
in a last-minute effort to buy time, insisted upon our creating a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
plant and accepting new contracts. Our only course under the circumstances
was to insist that they advance the entire amount of
the cost of the new facilities, some eight million dollars, and finance
the additional contracts for aircraft by advancing working capital
under terms agreeable to us. However, under French law, the state
was prohibited from investing its funds in a capital outlay on foreign
shores. Further, the French, at the time, were pursuing the opposite
policy at home; they were expropriating and nationalizing their own
industry—a policy that reduced the country from a position of
world leadership, following World War I, to one of abject dependence
upon American aviation in World War II. How they could
agree to go ahead with us under the circumstances we could not see,
especially with the Arms Embargo Act hanging over them. But
go ahead they did, and under our terms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the protracted negotiations, we went right
ahead, in our new War Plans Division, with all the blueprints and
schedules, working in close collaboration with our architect, Albert
Kahn. We broke ground for the new French plant on October 10,
1939, pushing automobiles out of the parking space on which we
had determined to build it. The shop was to have an area of some
300,000 square feet and be tooled to handle about 300 engines per
month of our 1830 model. Since this was an engine rated at approximately
1,000 horsepower, we figured that we were going to get
300,000 horsepower per month out of the new plant; in three months
we could build enough engines to generate the power of Niagara.
Title to the new facility would rest with United Aircraft. On November
5, 1939, Congress repealed the Arms Embargo Act.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, the British government came into the market
for aircraft. This was a surprise, for but a short time earlier, Lord
Beaverbrook, then visiting this country, had snorted at the suggestion
that Britain might have to look to America for assistance.
Yet Sir Henry Self, formerly of the British Air Ministry, arrived
in Washington and joined with M. René Plevin of France, in a new
coordinated procurement program.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this, on an evening early in 1940 while we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
sitting in the library at home, that the telephone rang. It was the
watchman over at the plant.</p>

<p>“Secretary Morgenthau has just walked in,” he said, “and he
would like to see you.”</p>

An Unfavorable Climate</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">As I backed my convertible out of the garage, and eased it from
the driveway onto Albany Avenue, I speculated as to what might
have brought Secretary Morgenthau to Hartford in the middle of
the night. It might, I thought, have something to do with the new
British inquiry which had been discussed earlier in Harry Collins’s
office in the Treasury. There, a number of aircraft manufacturers
had met to be introduced to Sir Henry Self and a newcomer to the
French negotiations, M. René Plevin. Sir Henry, very British, had
tried not to appear condescending to us provincials, but it was apparent
early that he had brought his trading vest along, determined
to give us a sample of British tradesmanship.</p>

<p>I had noticed at the time that Col. Paul Jacquin, with whom we
had had such intelligent dealings, was not present. M. René Plevin,
the new Frenchman, looked to me like the story-book Frenchman,
suave, polished, and clever. It occurred to me that Colonel Jacquin
might need a little help from us, and this was confirmed by the drift
of the conversation. Sir Henry Self made it clear that he and M.
Plevin would act in unison in all matters of future procurement.
They had looked over the earlier contracts and concluded that the
terms had not been as advantageous to the customer as must any
future terms. At any rate they appeared out of line with what had
been customary in Old England. The British were in the market
for large quantities of war material, but England was a poor country
and we must learn to sharpen our pencils and cut prices. England
had shielded us during the first war, but she was not now so strong,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Sir Henry had expressed interest in negotiating for the construction
of new facilities from which aircraft engine production could
flow; he had wondered if we might not now undertake immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
expansion of our facilities—but of course under more favorable terms
to England than we had apparently exacted from France.</p>

<p>To this I pointed out that the French terms had been arrived at
after painstaking negotiation under the commission headed by Col.
Paul Jacquin. They had not been predicated on chiseling tactics,
but designed to give us every incentive to take the heavy risks paramount
to quick deliveries. We had found no reason to question that
procedure but had, on the other hand, experienced many incidents
in which the wisdom of this procedure had been proved. Time had
been of the essence and time had proved to be something that could
not be bought. With less time now, we could see no basis for further
discussion of the terms.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I explained, we would not undertake to even
negotiate another contract for plant expansion until we saw our
way out of our present difficulties. We suffered from chronic indigestion
and had no intention of making it acute. And even if the
time came when we believed our already overloaded organization
might take on greater responsibilities, there was one serious road
block that must be resolved. We had accepted the French order
without resolving this difficulty because we had been in a serious
predicament for business; today we could not accept that handicap.</p>

<p>I referred to the matter of plant depreciation and the rules and
regulations of the Treasury Department. Unless these were changed,
a sudden cessation of hostilities might leave us with an enormous excess
of plant on our hands. The burden of depreciation, however
light under maximum output, would prove overwhelming after
shutdown. The day-to-day burden of writeoff would force on us
serious losses that would, in time, bankrupt the company. I pointed
out, of course, that this was a matter for the United States Treasury
rather than the British Purchasing Commission, but that we could not
undertake to construct new facilities even under terms similar to
those in the French contract, until after our Treasury Department
had resolved this problem of plant amortization and depreciation.</p>

<p>Now, as I sped down Albany Avenue to North Main Street and
turned left there down the Morgan Street hill to the Bulkely Memorial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Bridge, I reviewed the atmosphere of that meeting and began
to rehearse what I would say to Secretary Morgenthau, should he
bring the matter up. I recalled that Sir Henry Self had listened to
my statement with an expression of amused tolerance. No doubt he
had in mind the power of the Treasury and the influence of the
banking fraternity as means of bringing us upstarts into line. But
we were under no great obligations to others; we were free—free to
do what in our own judgment was in the long-term interest of getting
on with our job.</p>

<p>And as I turned into the main gate of the aircraft factory at East
Hartford, the lights were ablaze all over the place. I parked my car
in the garage under the office building and ran upstairs to my office
where the Secretary of the Treasury awaited me. After a greeting,
Mr. Morgenthau expressed a wish to see the new French addition,
and we walked together down through the main shop and across
to the new one. We had scheduled the new building for completion
in three months, and three months had seen it finished. The new
machinery, earmarked long in advance by War Plans and ordered
even before the final contract had been signed, was already coming
in. Bare spots revealed the wood-block floor of the vast girdered
structure, but millwrights were busy sliding machinery onto prearranged
spots and uncrating late arrivals. One complete production
line was already set up and working to relieve a bottleneck in the
main shop.</p>

<p>After a look-see, the secretary and I made our way back to my
corner office upstairs. He sat down in one of the big chairs and I
slid into the swivel seat behind my desk. On my walls hung the
mementos of bygone days. There in a silver frame was my commission
as a commander, and beneath it, all the others from passed
midshipman on up; beside it hung my certificate of graduation from
the Naval Academy. On other walls were collected the photographs
of my friends: Admiral Moffett, pipe in hand, with that alert look;
Admiral Reeves, from an oil painting by his own son, bearded like
the seamen of the old school and with that gleam in his eye; Chance
Vought, dapper with his waxed moustache; George Wheat, wise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
in the ways of a newspaper man; Comdr. Charles E. Kennedy-Purvis,
Royal Navy, a friend of my Grand Fleet days; Hap Arnold,
of the Army Air Corps; Jack Towers, of Naval Aviation; and Captain
Marco Zar, Argentine Navy. They were a goodly company.
The secretary glanced at them and then came to his point.</p>

<p>It was the British matter all right. Time was fleeting and he thought
we ought to get down to business and sign the contract. In reply,
I pointed out our position. We had accepted the French order without
first getting a commitment from the Treasury Department to
treat plant depreciation on a more realistic basis. We had, however,
set up our own books on the basis of synchronizing the plant writeoff
with the shipment of the product called for on the engine contract;
on this basis the plant would be completely written down
when the product shipments had been completed. That would tend
to reduce our taxable income for the period, but it would have the
advantage to our own government that all subsequent products of
that facility could be invoiced to it at no charge for depreciation
of plant. In case we became involved in a war, and that now seemed
probable, the government would recover in reduced costs everything
it might now lose in taxes.</p>

<p>I had the impression, as I talked, that the secretary did not entirely
follow me. I therefore went on to explain the situation more fully.
The rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Bureau might or
might not be satisfactory to some ordinary peacetime businesses.
I suspected they were not, as the desire to assess taxes currently
might easily lead to poor judgment for the long term. This was a
serious matter, since it tended to increase product costs by retarding
the purchase of improved machinery and thus impaired the
whole capital replacement problem. With us it was even more
critical because our situation was most unusual and called for broad
vision and judgment. I then took a long breath and said the little
piece I had rehearsed in the roadster on the way over.</p>

<p>“Mr. Secretary,” I said, “for the Treasury to treat this problem
in a way other than the one which we have set up would put the
Treasury in the position of profiteering—through excess taxation—on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
munitions contracts let here by foreign governments. We aircraft
manufacturers, having been maligned as profiteers, would not
like to see our government in the same boat.”</p>

<p>The secretary blinked at this, but did not reply.</p>

<p>“Mr. Secretary,” I continued, “we feel so strongly about the principles
involved here that we have taken a firm decision: we will not
go ahead on your British plant, until we have assurance of the treatment
we require.” The secretary still appeared unimpressed. However,
he did reply in his flat voice.</p>

<p>“I will see that it is done.”</p>

<p>The problem of plant expansion was but one of our many headaches.
In due course we signed the British contract calling for an
addition over half again as large as the French addition, and on
generally similar terms. For the next several years we waged fierce
battle with the Treasury Department over that problem of accelerated
depreciation and amortization of emergency facilities, only
to learn that the basic law precluded such treatment and could not
be amended save by act of Congress. But as luck would have it, when
the Treasury finally turned us down, the tax rates had been boosted
so high that their adverse decision actually gave us a better break
than we would have had with an earlier approval. And though this
proved gratifying from the balance-sheet point of view, the principle
remained an issue until finally resolved after the outbreak of the
European war.</p>

<p>To a harassed manufacturer, intent on production, it seemed incredible
that we Americans could be so stupid. At the time, we
ascribed it to ignorance. In our shop experience, no deliberate saboteur
could throw such backlash into a production line as just comes
naturally when a dumb-bunny do-gooder gets to messing around.
In the light of subsequent revelations, I am not so sure.</p>

A Spark Is Struck</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Don Brown’s death left a big gap in our ranks with no file closers
available to fill it. United Aircraft, once the only company in the
business with real depth to its management, had got thin on top. In
reorganization, the directors elected Fred Rentschler chairman, with
responsibility under the by-laws for the general conduct of the
business affairs of the company. I was elected president with the
authorities and responsibilities of chief executive officer. Raycroft
Walsh succeeded me as senior vice-president, and J. F. McCarthy
continued as controller with responsibility direct to the board of
directors in financial matters. This rounded up a top organization
in which the several personalities complemented each other in a
way calculated to promote the closest kind of teamwork. In the
four divisions, Jack Horner headed Pratt and Whitney, Sidney
Stewart succeeded Raycroft Walsh in Hamilton-Standard, and
C. J. McCarthy became general manager of the Vought-Sikorsky
Division.</p>

<p>Then came May of 1940. The President of the United States in
his fireside chat electrified the country with his announcement of
a fantastic airplane production program. The total mentioned was
50,000 airplanes. Only two weeks earlier, a House of Representatives’
Report on the War Department Appropriation Bill had lopped
all but 57 airplanes off the Army Air Corps’ own modest request for
496. By that time, some 2,800 airplanes had been contracted for
under the previous year’s appropriations, of which some 2,200 had
been training planes. Practically the entire capacity of the American
aircraft industry had been allotted to foreign sales. On the morning
following the Presidential foray into the numbers racket, I sat behind
my desk working on the mail.</p>

<p>Through the open door to the anteroom, I could see my secretary,
Mrs. Dexter, typing out some of the faultless copy with which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
kept our business flowing. She had come up to the front office with
me from Chance Vought Aircraft, and was one of the leading
women of the inner circle of highly trained and competent women
who managed the routine of the top executive offices. As the only
member of my office staff, she sorted out the mail and handled
visitors or outside calls. On the mail, she slid into the wastebasket
the bulk of it that was obviously part of the advertising matter which
Uncle Sam so kindly subsidizes at great expense to himself and the recipient.
A large part of the remainder Mrs. Dexter answered outright—and
more effectively than if I had handled it. The part that called
for decisions came to me—and even that was enough to keep a man
scrambling to try to keep the desk clean. How Mrs. Dexter, singlehanded,
could manage the flow of mail and calls was more than I
could understand but some wag of a punster had opined that she was
dexterous indeed. As I turned to my own pile of papers, the phone
bell jingled and she reached for the receiver.</p>

<p>“The Secretary of the Treasury is calling, sir,” she said, and then
added, “just a moment, Secretary Morgenthau.” I lifted my receiver.</p>

<p>“Could you come down to Washington,” came the flat voice, “and
have supper with me at my home Sunday evening?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Would you mind,” the voice inquired, “if I invited a competitor?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I answered. “May I ask who you have in mind?”</p>

<p>“Vaughan,” came the reply. “Guy Vaughan, of Curtiss-Wright.”
Something impelled me to try to inject a little humor into the colorless
colloquy.</p>

<p>“An honest competitor,” I laughed, “but with an inferior line.”
The phone clicked and I sat back to try to dope out what was going
on. A 50,000-plane program and the two big suppliers of aircraft
engines dining at the secretary’s home on a Sunday night! Shades of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Senator Black, and Postmaster General
Brown! Phil Johnson, of United Airlines, had chanced to drop in on
an informal conference called in the daytime to take away from him
air-mail contracts he had won under competitive bidding and Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
had crucified him for it! It all seemed to depend upon whose
political ox was to be gored.</p>

<p>I met Guy Vaughan in the Carlton Hotel on Sunday afternoon.
Guy had already scouted the terrain and discovered from “Tommy
the Cork,” so he said, that the bright boys intended to give us the
works at supper and force us to agree to license the government to
build aircraft engines under our patents. Why they should resort to
the cloak-and-dagger technique remained a mystery; they already
had such rights under numberless Army-Navy contracts. But there
seemed no mystery about why they wanted the licenses; the big
idea was to set up a string of big government-owned-and-operated
aircraft factories in the several distressed areas of the country to
give relief to the unemployed, and votes to their new employers.</p>

<p>Our quiet little supper party with Secretary Morgenthau did
seem to bear out Guy’s dope. For afterward, the secretary informed
us that since we were already overloaded with the foreign
business, our government would have to look elsewhere. He served
notice on us that we would be expected to license the government
under our patents. Guy Vaughan, on being questioned, advised the
secretary that in his opinion Curtiss-Wright could build all the engines
the government might require, and stated further that his company
would not license the government voluntarily on a program
that would put competitors into his business—and at government expense—who
would, after the war, put his company out of business.
In reply to the same question, I stated that we would license others
to build our engines.</p>

<p>The secretary indicated some surprise and inquired what our price
would be. When I replied that we would license them without fee,
the secretary appeared to disbelieve the statement and remarked that
he had never seen anything yet that was worth more than it cost.
To this I replied that there was a catch to it, and now the secretary
seemed ready to believe me.</p>

<p>From here I went on to point out that the manufacture of an aircraft
engine was an art that required skill, experience, and know-how;
few organizations anywhere had been successful in this field.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
If we licensed someone to build our product, we must still accept
responsibility for its performance—a responsibility that we had always
accepted. And since we accepted the responsibility, then we
must insist upon retaining authority over the choice of our licensees.
We had thought this through long ago as a part of our war plan;
a major war would stop production of many articles and throw men
out of employment. It would break up organizations and teams that
had the know-how of production and had demonstrated their competence
in their own lines. We would train such organizations in
the specialized technique of our business and thus get a good job.
As examples we suggested such organizations as the Ford Motor
Company, of Detroit, the Buick, Chevrolet, or Cadillac Divisions of
General Motors, the Nash-Kelvinator Company, the Packard Company,
Studebaker—in fact, you could go down the whole list and find
a great untapped source of skilled production experts.</p>

<p>I went on to contrast this with the possibility of government undertaking
the job. Without mentioning the difficulties peculiar to
government business, I stressed the responsibility that goes along
with aircraft production. When the engines fail, the airplane cracks
up and young men get killed. We had got many gray hairs carrying
this responsibility. If the government wanted to take it off our shoulders,
that was their privilege, but they should go into it with their
eyes open.</p>

<p>It was apparent by now that their eyes were fully open and we said
good night with mutual expressions of esteem. Soon George J. Mead,
once chief engineer of United Aircraft, then serving as vice-chairman
of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, had been
appointed to supervise the Treasury Department’s functions in the
50,000 program. This was good news indeed. For aside from the fact
that George Mead knew his airplanes, there was the further and
more important consideration that George knew the Army and
Navy each had skilled organizations, schooled in the procurement of
aeronautical materials, and was likely, after the details of the still
nebulous program had been determined, to give the highly technical
procurement job back to the Armed Forces. For had fate left this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
problem in the hands of one of the political agencies then springing
up all over the place, we might today be slaves of Hitler, Mussolini,
Hirohito, and Joe Stalin.</p>

<p>The government had either forgotten that the Army Reorganization
Act of 1920 placed responsibility for industrial mobilization
upon the Assistant Secretary of War, Louis Johnson, or, noting the
controversy between him and his chief, Secretary Woodring, had
changed its mind. In any event, Bill Knudsen was appointed Chairman
of the National Defense Advisory Committee and George
Mead took over the aircraft job. At the time, no one was able to enlighten
us on the real meaning of the 50,000-plane program; it might
be a yearly output, a war total, or anything else the fancy might
suggest. Nor could anyone advise us what types of aircraft were
contemplated. Scuttlebutt rumor had it that the President had first
asked the Army and Navy to submit estimates of the maximum number
of aircraft they could use but upon receipt of the figures had been
disappointed at their lack of imagination. They couldn’t seem to add
up to more than a few thousand.</p>

<p>His own first figure, so the gossip went, had been a nice round
25,000, the very number, curiously enough, which had been hit upon
back in 1917 as the number required to “darken the skies” over Germany.
But later, so ran the story, the President had tried out his fireside
chat on Lord Beaverbrook, the same “Beaver” who, not many
weeks earlier, had snorted his scorn at the suggestion that England
would ever have to look to America for aircraft production. And
the Beaver, so we were told, had advised the President not to be a
piker—100,000 airplanes would make better headlines—and the
President had compromised on 50,000. In any event, BUAERO and
Wright Field had now dubbed the announcement “the numbers
racket,” so the fact that a fellow like George Mead, who not only
knew the words and music of aviation but could actually sing the
song, was now handling the aircraft program seemed to us an incredibly
lucky break.</p>

<p>And so it proved, for George got the two services to agree upon
the reasonableness of some kind of program that seemed to add up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
to 50,000 and then passed the job back to them for execution. This
put the ball back in play on a field where we knew the score and
where the officials knew the rules and the game. It converted the
war from a phony to a shooting war, and gave us the signal for
take-off.</p>

<p>Now as the new British addition began to take form, we put our
War Plans Division to work on a new American addition. This we
decided to create in two steps and to finance with funds to be acquired
in the market. Designed to utilize the entire capacity of the
East Hartford area, the addition would double the total facilities
already in hand. Our carefully prepared war plan contemplated
farming out more and more of the work to subcontractors and suppliers
as rapidly as they could be trained to manufacture to our high
standards of precision and workmanship. The original manufacturing
concept of Pratt and Whitney, Hamilton-Standard, and Vought
had contemplated utilizing the skills and facilities of other competent
shops in peacetime and in the interest of economy; now we
embarked on our long-contemplated program of expansion of this
technique in the interest of accelerated war production.</p>

<p>The capacity of any working area such as East Hartford is definitely
limited by physical characteristics, such as transport, electric
power, water supply, labor supply, housing, and so on. These limits,
as they existed in peacetime, could be expanded to meet wartime
needs by close cooperation with the management of the utilities. The
War Plans Division, having foreseen the limitations of the several
factors, had provided us with the information on which to approach
our numerous suppliers of all kinds. Certain of these, like the power
companies, whose normal business contemplated a continuous expansion
of facilities to meet normal demands, used the information
furnished them to arrive at decisions to advance their schedules
wherever necessary to meet peak demands. Now “the aircraft,” as
we were called in Hartford, moved out of the category of a speculative
venture and into the position of the controlling industry of the
area. Our whole philosophy of leadership, based as it was on the cooperative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
process, now paid off, not alone in returns to us but to our
neighbors and, in fact, to the whole country.</p>

<p>In this connection, reference can be made to a report on “Industrial
Mobilization and Design and Development of Nazi Germany,”
issued by the Office of Military Government for Germany under
date of October 5, 1945. The report is based on an examination of
Albert Speer by several officers of the Intelligence Department, and
deals with the part Speer played subsequent to the year 1942 when
he was directed to take over the administration of German war production.
Speer had realized immediately what great fundamental errors
had been committed and how small armament output had remained
prior to his taking over. The Reichswehr had dealt with
armament problems theoretically and industry generally had had no
great inclination to participate in preparatory work. The government
organizations had become so large that they had managed only
to keep each other busy; they committed what might be called mental
incest and paved the way for all the mistakes that had later kept
armament production at a surprisingly low level.</p>

<p>Speer had gone on to say that the Germans had been at a great
disadvantage because their rearmament had been planned too long
on a theoretic basis. A strict system of discipline and orders fully in
accord with their authoritarian regime had replaced what this apparatus
lacked in knowledge and ability. He had written a memorandum
to Hitler on July 20, 1944, in which he stated that Russia
and the United States were to be envied because external circumstances
had forced them to improvise. The United States had had to
raise their armed forces quickly and therefore could not do without
the active personalities in industry, politics, and public life. In Germany,
on the other hand, those who occupied themselves with war
production were professional soldiers, a closed corporation without
the benefit of fresh outside minds. For this reason, Speer believed
that the extended theoretical preparation of German armaments had
been mainly responsible for their low level of production until after
1942 when he had restored the principle of individual initiative by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
putting war production back into the hands of private industry.
Within a year he had completed an organization of completely new
leading personalities to restore the autonomy of industry and preserve
its unity even in the most trying times.</p>

<p>The virus that infected Germany also attacked us, but our rugged
constitution enabled us to throw it off.</p>

For What Is a Man Profited?</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The selection of Bill Knudsen to head up the agency charged with
coordinating war production was a happy one. Just as George Mead
knew his aircraft, so did Bill Knudsen know his production. Furthermore,
he knew the men who knew production and he held their
confidence and regard. This was important at the moment when
business and industry had reason to fear and suspect government;
the drift in this country toward the omnipotent state had aroused
intense bitterness and might have bogged down the whole program
had not Bill Knudsen attracted to his organization other men who
held the respect of their fellow manufacturers. These men began
immediately on the complex task of unraveling all the mare’s nests
that had collected around government procurement.</p>

<p>About the middle of the summer of 1940, Fred Rentschler and
I went down to Washington to call on the Grand Old Man and outline
to him the key to our whole program. The President’s 50,000-plane
program, when superimposed on the already staggering foreign
purchases, was clearly beyond the total capacity of the New England
area. And if we undertook further expansion in other areas, we
would impose further burdens on an already hard-pressed staff.
The time had now come to bring in the great automotive industry.</p>

<p>Since Knudsen had, until recently, been president of the General
Motors Corporation, we saw little hope of interesting him in diverting
Buick or Chevrolet to aircraft-engine production just yet. For
our automobile manufacturers still remembered the treatment given
them back in 1918 when, after the Armistice, their war contracts
had been ruthlessly canceled—torn up like so many scraps of paper—and
their “war profits” had vanished from view except in the news
headlines of the next twenty years. It would take some doing to
persuade Bill Knudsen to our cause, and even Bill Knudsen would
have his work cut out to get his automotive friends on the beam.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
As a matter of fact, without Bill Knudsen it could never have been
done in time.</p>

<p>For Bill was animated throughout his wartime service by a great
motive. He had come to the Land of the Free a penniless immigrant,
and had there won not alone riches but the respect and esteem of the
great men of the land. And whatever the generation which had inherited
liberty might think about it, Bill Knudsen knew what liberty
meant; his whole being was imbued with a love for the country of
his adoption, with a devotion to the spirit which animated it and
an intense zeal to pay back in part some of the privileges it had extended
him. And so deeply was this zeal imbedded in his character
and so honestly did he seek to pay back his debt that even men grown
cynical under the lash of government were impelled to go along.
His simple fundamental character combined with his native wit and
intelligence gave Bill Knudsen such qualities of leadership at the
very moment they were most needed.</p>

<p>The day Fred Rentschler and I walked in on him, we found him
leaning over a plain table pawing around among some engine parts
with George Mead and Henry Crane. “Uncle Henry” Crane, one
of the great engineers of the automotive industry, had been called
in for a conference over the failures of the Allison liquid-cooled
engine. While Fred and I cooled our heels waiting for experts to
decide upon what design changes were necessary to make the Allison
run, before they could discuss policy with us, we thought we saw
a certain irony in the situation. For the Allison engine was the power
plant that had taken the business away from our 1830 engine in the
critical months of 1939 when that one contract meant so much to
Pratt and Whitney.</p>

<p>When, finally, it came our turn, we broke the news to Bill Knudsen
that, with the completion of the new American addition in Hartford,
we would reach a saturation point in Hartford and must look elsewhere
for new facilities. Bill knew that Wright Aeronautical planned
to build a big new shop somewhere in Ohio and presumed, of course,
we would go and do likewise, but when we explained the differences
in our two situations, he understood. Wright Aero had been formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
out of the consolidation of two big engine companies, Curtiss and
Wright, and had more topside staff than Pratt and Whitney. Guy
Vaughan was still its president, but Don Brown had died. Now when
we mentioned licensing the automotive companies, Bill’s first question
was who did we have in mind. When we told him Ford, he
at first shook his head, but when we stressed the point that selling
Uncle Henry was his job and that no one except he and George
Mead could do it, Bill Knudsen reluctantly agreed to try.</p>

<p>And Bill and George succeeded. Within a few days we received
word that Ford Motor would send a group of shopmen to look over
the job and see what could be done. Bill Knudsen, familiar with the
Ford setup, had suggested that the machinery in the great Ford
tool room, along with some six thousand men employed there, would
take the Pratt and Whitney job in its stride. To automotive men,
the aircraft industry still looked something like the ancient “carriage
trade,” and they discounted our insistence that our standards of quality
and precision were not easily come by in the mass-production
industries.</p>

<p>Edsel Ford and Charles Sorenson met with Fred Rentschler and
me in the boardroom in East Hartford. Sorenson did most of the
talking, though Edsel Ford was president of the company. A rough-and-tumble
shopman of the Ford school of give and take, Sorenson
wasted few words. His men had looked the shop over and found
nothing complicated about it—nothing they didn’t savvy. The machine
tools seemed standard and the processes excellent. At first his
boys had thought the job looked easy, but the more they had seen
of our precision, the more they had become impressed with the task
before them. At first they had thought we might be overdoing the
quality but after a look at the test-shed running and studying the
high demands for durability and dependability, they had changed
their minds. They realized it was a tough racket but were prepared
to go ahead on two conditions.</p>

<p>First, they would have to adopt our technique in every detail and
even have to build a complete new aircraft-engine shop; the idea that
their tool room would serve was fantastic, the machines wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
do at all. Second, they would have to have access to our suppliers
and subcontractors for parts; they could not find other sources of
supply. He presumed, of course, that we would give them every
assistance and even detail our foremen and leading men to duty in
the Ford shops as necessary.</p>

<p>Sorenson’s requirement as to our suppliers posed a problem; most
of them were already overloaded. Some like Wyman Gordon, of
Worcester, source of our crankshaft and other forgings, were already
suppliers to the automotive industry, and could shift their production
from autos to aircraft. This had been a long-time feature of our
war plans and it applied to many of our parts. On the others we
would share the output with Ford and join him in creating new
sources. With that decision we all shook hands and it was a deal.</p>

<p>One thing that had impressed the Ford people was the vast difference
between the aircraft and automotive processes. Our production
was based on the use of standard machine tools; we had few of
the special single-purpose machines designed for low-cost volume
production of automobiles. Our practice had been deliberately
adopted for several reasons. In expanding for war-emergency production
we could expect machine tool builders rapidly to expand
delivery of standard machines, where special machines would require
much longer. Again, whereas automotive production could be standardized
for reasonable periods, in aircraft engines we must be able to
incorporate every new design change without seriously retarding
production. To accomplish this, we had fitted special jigs and fixtures
to our standard machines; for a design change we could scrap
the fixtures but keep the machines running. No such flexibility as
this could be had with the special machines of the automotive shops,
and Sorenson’s crew had spotted this right away. In fact, if anyone
thought we could learn much about production from the automotive
boys, he soon found it was the other way around. They
learned from us our secret of aircraft war production, the revolutionary
idea of flexibility in volume.</p>

<p>Along with this idea we had developed the aircraft-type assembly
of components. Instead of using a conveyer to regulate production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
rates, we used it to transport materials to the assembly points. Here
the workers built up complete units or subassemblies and inspected
them on the spot. Aside from the flexibility thus introduced, the idea
had an impact on our production workers. We did away with the
deadly monotony of repetitive processes, by feeding to the operators
such precisely machined parts that even the unskilled could assemble
finished devices and test their functioning. And now as we lost our
experienced workers to the armed forces and began replacing them
with recruits from the white-collar trades, we found this gave a
tremendous boost to shop morale. In the development of this process,
I found myself thinking frequently of the scene in Charlie Chaplin’s
picture where he finally uses both hands and both feet to feed nuts
and washers into the ever-moving and compelling assembly.</p>

<p>Now after Ford had broken the ice, Bill Knudsen began bringing
in other automotive plants to help us. The great Buick and Chevrolet
companies of General Motors joined up, followed soon by Nash.
After Curtice of Buick and Coyle of Chevrolet and Mason of Nash
had worked out general principles with our top management, the jobs
were taken over by the keen shopmen who had made all those organizations
great. In some cases our new allies took on responsibilities
for Hamilton-Standard Propellers and, in the case of Nash, they
even went into production on helicopters when, later on, we faced
that new demand. Chance Vought teamed up with Goodyear Rubber
and others, on the licensing of product and every division of United
spread out all over the country to bring in competent suppliers, large
and small.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after Bill Knudsen had set up the aircraft program
and George Mead had turned it back to the armed forces for administration,
we ran into stormy weather on the matter of deliveries. The
schedules set up by the Army and Navy were fantastic. Among
other things, the two services had long neglected to buy engines
and propellers for training planes and now, of course, immediate
delivery of these was called for. Our plants had been tooled for
foreign account on the 1,000-hp 1830’s, and the trainers called for
400-hp Wasp Jrs. for which we had no jigs or fixtures in quantity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Save for our flexible-production scheme, this problem would have
thrown us for a loss, and even then we had to hustle to retool. Before
we had learned the rudiments of the expanded program,
the politicians had begun scrambling for cover. Even some of our
military friends began casting about for excuses to blame the manufacturers
for their own shortcomings. Newspaper columnists and
radio commentators who had previously castigated us as war
mongers now began screaming “too little and too late.”</p>

<p>One of the most acid of these, Fulton Lewis, Jr., made a special
trip to Hartford to give his public an on-the-spot disclosure of the
shortcomings at United Aircraft. His Hartford outlet then was
WTHT, <cite>The Hartford Times</cite>, whose publisher, Francis S. Murphy,
was familiar with our problems “Over East,” as we say up here.
Frank suggested that Fulton Lewis call on me, and I, all unsuspecting,
gave him a personally conducted tour of the shops and then,
back in my office, told him some of our problems. Fulton Lewis,
surprised by what he saw, asked me if I would go on the radio with
him that night. Afterward, he sold the National Association of
Manufacturers on his idea of sending a group of commentators of
press and radio on a nation-wide tour of factories to learn the truth
about “too little and too late.”</p>

<p>As I came to know some of the radio commentators, I was impressed
by the skill with which some of them dug the germ of the
news out of the ruck and got it over to their listeners. After Cedric
Foster left Hartford for Boston to take over his spot on Mutual,
he made it a habit to call his old friends for their slants on spot news.
My experience with Admiral Reeves having taught me to delve
for fundamentals in strategy and tactics, I was able to give Cedric
some slants on the progress of the war. I was always impressed by
the way in which he put his finger on the key items and summarized
the situation succinctly and competently.</p>

<p>Our rate of production was largely dependent upon things outside
our control. Both Army and Navy made contracts with us and
each administered his own business in his own peculiar way. Each
maintained a staff of inspectors at our plants, men who sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
liked to show their authority over us and to put each other on the
spot. Each specified the accessories to our equipment according to
his own fancies, and even specified details. On this matter of accessories,
the British and French had their own ideas, and in some cases
these differed from either Army or Navy. A single model of our
engine might have as many variations as there were customers to
buy them or airplanes in which to install them, and the permutations
and combinations ran into complications of all sorts. In an effort to
correct some of this, I used the delivery schedule as a lever.</p>

<p>I agreed to accept their fantastic schedules <em>in toto</em>, provided three
requirements were met: First, one of the services would handle all
contracts for our company and administer them for all the others;
second, all the services would standardize their accessories and attachments
as well as their specifications so as to simplify models;
third, the service administering the contracts would require its inspectors
to do all those reasonable things intended to expedite deliveries
according to the terms of the contracts and its specifications,
rather than operate as an obstacle. To the degree that any or all of
these requirements were not met, we now submitted delayed delivery
schedules to correspond with each degree. Under this pressure, the
services agreed to divide the two engine companies; Pratt and
Whitney became the charge of the Navy.</p>

<p>It was when we came to prices for engines that we ran into
trouble. After Jack Homer had discussed the problem with
BUAERO as to details, J. F. McCarthy and I went to Washington
to face the issues with Comdr. L. B. Richardson, then in charge of
Procurement. This was not the Captain Dick Richardson of the
big-boat formula fame, but a younger Dick with whom I had flown
in the service. He knew his business and had positive ideas based on
wide experience. On contracts calling for such large volume, the
Bureau would expect a far lower price than any we had quoted—and
in principle it was right. Our problem was that, pending expansion
of the shop, the training of new operators, the testing of
tools, and all the other problems of getting into production, we
would run into high costs. That had been our experience during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
the expansion periods with the French and British contracts and
now with the likelihood that we would lose even some of our key
men to the armed forces, we could expect spoiled work and scrap
to skyrocket costs. No one could guess when costs could be brought
into line, and it seemed almost impossible to arrive at a price agreeable
to both sides.</p>

<p>And this problem of price might have delayed negotiations interminably
had we not taken an important decision to break the
deadlock. This decision was based on long experience in business
for government account and on a background of events that have
been herein related. It dated back to that provision in the Air Corps
Act of 1926, in which we granted the government the right to keep
cost inspectors in our plant. To break the impasse we now proposed
that if BUAERO would establish fixed prices on our contracts on
the basis of our earlier experience, we would undertake voluntarily
to reduce future invoice prices on products yet to be shipped, to the
end that we would never accumulate any excessive profit. In other
words, since neither we nor the Bureau could stand any future criticism
on profits, we would voluntarily renegotiate ourselves to avoid
excessive profit. The Bureau’s resident cost inspectors, with access to
all our books, would furnish the data on which the Bureau could
judge the reasonableness of our performance, and we would abide
by their judgment.</p>

<p>This fateful decision removed the last obstacle and cleared the
right of way to the high ball. The remaining problem was to settle
upon a sound principle for determining fair profit. During the busy
year 1940, one which could be taken as indicating the return which
a plant of our character could earn under other than wartime conditions,
we had earned $12,000,000 with a plant provided by our own
capital, on sales made of our own initiative, and on shipments that
included practically no business with the United States government.
If now we were to freeze our annual net earnings at that figure no
matter how our sales might soar nor how our plant might be increased
at public expense, we would be stabilizing our earnings at an
experienced level that seemed capable of justification from the points
of view of the stockholder and the public. If in this process we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
earn that return and still pay our employees reasonable wages and
salaries, then we would be discharging our responsibility to all concerned.</p>

<p>As a measure of the effectiveness of this principle we may have
recourse to an incident that occurred some months later, when production
had begun to roll and costs had cascaded to unprecedentedly
low levels. After assembling the figures, we had advised the Bureau
formally that, effective at the beginning of the next quarter, we
would reduce invoice prices below the contract fixed prices by a
certain figure per engine calculated to avoid any accumulation of
excessive profits. The total relinquishment of potential profits was
calculated to amount to approximately $10,000,000. Meanwhile, we
had adjusted wages and salaries on a merit basis for all except top
executives. On the day this news appeared I was making one of my
customary tours through the shop when one of the workers detached
himself from a big Bullard machine and headed out to cut me off in
the aisle.</p>

<p>He was a big brute with beetling black eyebrows and a sullen
mouth, yet as he caught up with me the hard look melted away before
a big grin and he stuck out a grimy fist.</p>

<p>“Mister,” he said, gripping my hand in his big paw, “I’d go to hell
for a company that won’t profiteer. And, mister,” he added, “that
goes for a lot of other guys in this shop, too.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Air Corps Act of 1926 had made provision
for this type of profit control, Congress had passed an amendment
to the Vinson-Trammel Act in 1934, imposing a further
statutory limit on profits under contracts for shipbuilding and aircraft
production. The wartime Excess Profits Tax purported to
further regulate profits but of course only created waste. The manufacturer
had to add the tax to the price of his product anyway.
The act encouraged management to take decisions which, though
unsound economically, looked smart taxwise. Expense accounts
chargeable to cost of product soared to heights undreamed of in
competitive business. Political in character, uneconomic in principle,
the Excess Profits Tax swelled the costs of war while giving a false
impression of profit limitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>The Price Adjustment Act, commonly called “renegotiation,”
was the really effective means of profit control. Under it, competent
price adjustment boards set up the ground rules and administered
them with justice to those concerned. Yet this legislation, despite the
fact that it was fundamentally in the interest of private industry,
was passed with such a flavor of punitive action against business that
even the wisest industrialists were tricked into fighting it as just another
attack on the profit motive. Too many of us, unfortunately,
were so busy hating Roosevelt that we forgot how to use our brains.</p>

<p>Under wise leadership the whole thing could have been turned
around into a constructive effort. Had the administration called in
representatives from the many industries and put the problem
squarely before them along with an appeal to their patriotism, there
would have been no problem. Voluntary, industry-wide action
would have been forthcoming to keep industry on a sound financial
basis, and the example thus set must certainly have brought wage
rates within bounds. Had a routine been set up under which the
government agreed to utilize privately owned facilities on terms that
would compensate owners for their use and restore them as nearly
as possible to their original status, details could have been handled
by price adjustment boards in a cooperative manner. Punitive laws
could have been reserved for culprits, and industry would have
helped police the economy.</p>

<p>My own convictions as to the efficacy of voluntary processes stem
out of experiences in two wars. In World War I, Herbert Hoover,
relying upon good leadership to prevent shortages, gave a convincing
demonstration of what the American people can do voluntarily
in such an emergency. In World War II, at the very moment when
my company was being frustrated at every turn by arbitrary controls
on men, money, machines, and materials, I acted as chairman of
the Connecticut State War Finance Committee and saw the people
rally to the brilliant leadership of two able young men in the
Treasury Department, Ted Gamble and Bob Coyne, who raised
billions of dollars that would never have been forthcoming under
any compulsion.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The German attack on Russia immediately converted a lot of former
pacifists into bloodthirsty warmongers. With that everybody
began trying to get into the act. We, who had once been crucified for
warmongering, now found ourselves charged with “too little and
too late.” The war cry now became “unconditional surrender,”
a phrase that had a hollow ring to men who had watched Woodrow
Wilson end World War I with his “Fourteen Points” by dividing
the German people and the German Kaiser.</p>

<p>In this country everybody became overnight an expert on war
production and a critic of the professionals. The professionals, unfortunately,
must always bear the responsibility for their actions,
while their critics can and do speak with the advantage of irresponsibility.
The newspapers now began to ballyhoo the “Reuther plan”
as the answer to everything and news commentators belabored the
ether with a cacophony of approval. From his office in the War
Production Board, Bill Knudsen called us on the telephone.</p>

<p>“You know this fellow Reuther?” he inquired, pronouncing the
name as if it spelled Rooter.</p>

<p>Yes, we knew about Reuther from the headlines. With his usual
flair for publicity, he had crashed the front pages with the bright
idea of putting all the machine tools of the automotive industry,
now laying off men to convert to war production, into construction
of airplanes under the mass-production principle. To an expert like
Reuther, the idea of buying new machinery just to build airplane
engines smacked of another grab by the bosses. Its reaction on Bill
Knudsen had prompted this call for help.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with that delightful Danish accent, “what are
we going to do about him?”</p>

<p>Fred Rentschler thought a moment. “Send him up here,” he replied.
“We’ll take care of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>And when Walter Reuther arrived at “The Aircraft” in East
Hartford, he was mustered into the board room and received by all
the principal officers of the company. After he had stated his case
bluntly, sparing no wallops at the “carriage trade,” we assured him
that if he knew where we could get the kind of tools we needed, he
was just the man we were looking for. Maybe he had better quit the
union and go to work for us. We had combed the countryside for
suitable tools but had not been able to find any. As a mechanic,
Reuther would know machine tools, and we would like to have his
help.</p>

<p>Reuther descended into the shop with our supervisors, who
walked him for miles over the entire layout. On his return he pronounced
the verdict. The stored machines he’d had in mind were no
good for our job, after all. He’d had no idea we were doing a watchmaker’s
job. What he didn’t know was that watchmakers’ tolerances
were far too crude for the exacting demands of aircraft engines.</p>

<p>After Reuther had gone back to Washington, one of our old-timers
lingered a moment in the board room.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to hand it to that cocky little redhead,” he said
slowly. “He sure knows publicity.”</p>

<p>But aptitude for show business was not wholly monopolized by
either labor leaders or politicians; some industrialists got around, too.
Notable among these was Mr. Henry J. Kaiser. After the private
shipbuilders had developed their new technique of constructing
components for assembly in the finished vessel, it was Mr. Kaiser,
the dam builder, who caught the public eye as the boss shipbuilder
of them all. And his activities were not limited to shipbuilding; he
was into everything. After Igor Sikorsky had finally performed the
impossible by creating the helicopter, his fame was almost overshadowed
by headlines hailing Mr. Kaiser as the great producer of
this new contraption. Again, when the German submarine blockade
had attained the peak of its effectiveness, it was Mr. Kaiser who
crashed the headlines with that hair-raising proposal of his, calling
for the construction of 5,000 huge flying boats weighing 500,000
pounds each, with which to leapfrog the German submersibles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>A recognized aircraft constructor with the temerity to point out
that no such craft had even been projected, let alone designed or
tested experimentally, or that the industrial capacity of the nation
had already been stretched to the elastic limit, would put himself in
the position of lacking imagination. And when, finally, the tide of
public opinion forced the President to place an order for such a
craft, the contract was awarded to Howard Hughes, and Mr. Kaiser,
having promoted the idea, stepped gracefully aside. The President
afterward testified to the power of such propaganda when he told
Don Douglas he had felt compelled to award the contract to get
Henry Kaiser off his neck.</p>

<p>The appointment of Sidney Hillman as co-chairman with Bill
Knudsen on the War Production Board was consistent with the
philosophies of a period that held management responsible for production
over which labor exercised authority. The idea that labor
should earn the right through production rather than the blackjack
was too, too old-fashioned. When, therefore, the big unions moved
in on the West Coast aircraft companies in an attempt to dictate
industry-wide wage rates, Sidney Hillman, after beating the drums
to arouse the tribes to the necessary frenzy, summoned leaders of the
aircraft industry to Washington for a little “collective” bargaining.
The idea, it was said, was “to put the ‘C’ in ‘D.C.’”</p>

<p>At the moment, this looked like but one of the fantasies of that
mad era. In retrospect it takes on definite form. We who had created
a vital industry were put on the defensive as profiteers by leaders
of a publicly supported labor monopoly, itself bent on profiteering.
Whatever profit we might be allowed was a matter of law. As suppliers
to the government, we were responsible to the people for
keeping costs down. The workers, largely unskilled, were being
urged by their leaders to slow down, while the same leaders blackjacked
the public for higher wages for less work. All this, in the
task of making the tools for the public’s defense.</p>

<p>The situation, largely chargeable to the Nye investigation and
similar episodes, could have been avoided under leadership of a
different character. A clear statement of the fundamentals, accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
by an appeal to industry, labor, and the public, could have
resolved the internal conflict into an all-out cooperative effort, but
none was forthcoming. The political atmosphere of the time resembled
that described by C. W. C. Oman in his book, <cite>The Seven
Roman Statesmen</cite>, first published by Edward Arnold &amp; Co., London,
1902. In Rome, the politicians from Tiberius Gracchus to Pompey,
who paved the way for the Emperor Julius Caesar, bought the
votes of the proletariat with money created by enterprising men and,
while they gained fame for themselves, deprived the people of
freedom.</p>

<p>The formal meeting took place in an ornate conference room
on the fifth floor of the new Social Security Building. We manufacturers,
after proving our identities, were shown the entrance
to an escalator which we discovered went only as far as the fourth
floor. That word “escalator” had been borrowed in war contracts
as a means of partial protection against unforeseen wage hikes.</p>

<p>To a large gathering round the council table, Sidney Hillman
pointed out that, since collective bargaining in Southern California
had broken down, Washington had been forced to settle wages,
working conditions, and similar matters—for the entire industry.
The decision, it appeared, had already been taken at a high level
and we might just as well relax and enjoy it.</p>

<p>Our position was stated by a spokesman who pointed out that
if labor would step up its output and reduce costs, the employer
could meet the demands out of savings in cost. If, however, government
increased labor rates without correspondingly modifying sales-prices,
it would bankrupt manufacturers.</p>

<p>Sidney Hillman listened to our point of view with amused tolerance
and then played his ace.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he remarked, “you are protected by the escalator
clause.”</p>

<p>Reuben Fleet, of Consolidated, twisted in his chair and swallowed
an aspirin tablet.</p>

<p>“When we came up to this fifth floor this morning,” he said, “they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
showed us the escalator. But,” he added, wagging a finger in Sidney
Hillman’s face, “the escalator stopped at the fourth floor.”</p>

<p>At this pat retort the contractors gave vent to a whoop that broke
up the meeting.</p>

<p>Shortly after President Roosevelt’s announcement of his 50,000-airplane
program, or the “numbers racket,” newspaper headlines
flared the story that government had called industry leaders to
Washington to tell them off for their crime, “too little and too late.”
The call brought Phil Johnson from far-off Seattle, Donald Douglas,
Bob Gross, and Dutch Kindleberger from Los Angeles, and others
from farther or nearer. Phil Johnson, once driven out of air transport,
had now been called back to Boeing to build heavy bombers.</p>

<p>But when we manufacturers foregathered together and proceeded
to the assigned meeting places, we found the rooms so jammed with
sound cameras, klieg lights, and heavy cable, there was room for but
a few of the better-publicized culprits. The others watched through
doors and windows while big politicos mugged cameras that would
flicker their message to the hinterlands. Most of us had to see the
newsreels to find out what message it was we had traveled so far to
receive.</p>

<p>The problem of how to expand production, train licensees, and
meet all Selective Service demands was always with us. For all
United Aircraft divisions had accepted the responsibility for servicing
in the field all equipment of our design whether manufactured
by us or anyone else. This kept hundreds of trained service men in
the field, including many in the front lines.</p>

<p>One day I received a visit from my old friend Joe Beach, former
mayor of Hartford, once a good citizen but then a major assigned
to the Army Personnel Procurement Branch. Joe, who knew our
problems, regretfully advised me that he had received orders to
recruit, from Pratt and Whitney, several hundred men conforming
to a specification that described our best-trained field-service men,
specialists who could be replaced only with the greatest difficulty.
Joe tried to soften the blow by saying the men would be immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
commissioned captains or colonels or something. The Army would
not take “no” for an answer; it was come across or else.</p>

<p>In this tough spot, I phoned for “Tiny” Flynn, our service manager,
and with Joe listening asked him how many of his staff had
been inducted into the Army and what the Army had done with
them. The answers were “plenty” and “K.P.” or “latrine duty.”
I then asked Tiny if he had their present addresses, and when Tiny
answered in the affirmative, Joe grinned and walked out. Later he
confessed to having never sprung one of these men out of “K.P.”</p>

<p>After the Jap sneak attack on Pearl Harbor I called on my old
friend Admiral Reeves in Washington to get his slant on what had
happened. The admiral, now retired, had been recalled to active duty
and assigned to the Navy Department in charge of Navy lend-lease.
Always an Anglophobe, he there tried to keep our English cousins
within reasonable bounds. Considerably older now, the admiral was
said to require two traffic lights to get across the expanse of Constitution
Avenue, but the old spirit flamed.</p>

<p>“The one thing the administration needed to bring the people into
the war on the side of the British,” he explained, with that sweeping
gesture of his, “was Pearl Harbor. Who could have expected them
to be so dumb as to play right into our own hand? Our big surprise
wasn’t Pearl Harbor; what defeated us was that the Japs could be
so dumb.”</p>

<p>After the attack, the admiral was ordered to Pearl Harbor as a
member of the Roberts Board to investigate the efficacy of the
Japanese assault under a strategic concept which the admiral had
conceived but his contemporaries had not understood.</p>

<p>Following Pearl Harbor, aircraft production shifted to full throttle.
Under Bill Knudsen’s leadership, Ford, Buick, Chevrolet, and
Nash created new facilities and shipped United products. Wright
Aeronautical first built a huge plant near Cincinnati and then drew
Studebaker and Chrysler into the complex. At United we stepped
employment up to 75,000 and thought we had attained our peak
production. Then we were called to Washington and told to build
a new plant somewhere out west, one bigger than the Hartford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
establishment. This looked at first like the straw to break the camel’s
back, yet Jack Horner discovered an ideal plant site in Kansas City,
Missouri.</p>

<p>In undertaking this job for BUAERO, we pointed out that we had
no funds of our own with which to finance either construction or
operation. We therefore suggested that we take the job on without
profit to ourselves. The plant could be constructed by the Defense
Plant Corporation under our plans and, when it came to operations,
the Navy could put a disbursing officer at Kansas City who would
pay the vouchers and invoices certified to him by our manager and
approved by the Navy inspector. This was a procedure we had tested
in Canada where James Young, president of our Canadian Pratt and
Whitney, had been called on to build a propeller plant in Montreal.</p>

<p>Under that program His Majesty’s Government had deposited
funds in the local bank which were disbursed by His Majesty’s disbursing
officer in payment for services and materials approved by
His Majesty’s inspector. And if His Majesty’s inspector elected to
reject work in process, or exercise any other authority commonly
assumed by government inspectors everywhere, then it was His
Majesty’s hard luck, not the manufacturer’s. In other words, our
nonprofit proposal was not entirely altruistic; we were also concerned
with avoiding losses.</p>

<p>But now it developed that we must be allowed to earn some profit,
in order to be able to absorb items of cost which one inspector or
another might not allow. Thus when we made a contribution to
the local Community Chest drive, and a cost inspector ruled it out as
illegal, there must be some place for us to recover the expense. And
so we finally accepted a nominal “profit” with the provision that
any amount left over after all “illegal” fees had been paid would
revert to His Majesty—or rather to Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>But the important fact developed by this transaction was that it
was entirely possible for a reputable constructor in wartime to perform
a public service without “profit” in the usual sense, and do an
outstanding job at it. As a matter of fundamental equity, United
Aircraft Corporation risked none of its funds in this effort and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
not, therefore, entitled to receive profit for it, especially when its
own resources were being fully employed and were earning a fair
return. The principle here is that each enterprise engaged temporarily
in the war effort has a distinctive problem of its own and no
over-all legislation can be written to cover individual cases in an
equitable manner. The place to reach decisions on these matters
was the Price Adjustment Board.</p>

<p>As between United Aircraft and its licensees, the relationship was
one of mutual respect and close cooperation. We spoke the same
language and subscribed to the same principles. One could not say
as much for relations between the airplane builders and the automotive
industry. One day Dutch Kindleberger trumpeted a blast,
pooh-poohing the automobile manufacturers as significant producers
of airplanes, an outburst that threatened to revive the ancient
feud between the mass production industry and the “carriage
trade.” This snort coincided with the mailing of a letter I had written
to President Harlow Curtice of the Buick Division, complimenting
him on the job Buick had turned in by constructing a new engine
plant near Chicago, and getting it rolling. In reply to my letter Mr.
Curtice later used a pat phrase which seemed appropriate to an address
I was scheduled to deliver before the annual meeting of the
Union League Club in Chicago.</p>

<p>I therefore suggested to the Union League dinner committee that
they invite Mr. Curtice to sit at the speakers’ table so that I might
make acknowledgment of the Buick performance. The address was
being broadcast over a nationwide hookup and I had taken for my
title “The Fundamentals of Freedom.” I reviewed the airplane story
and took as my theme the idea that the magic of the aircraft performance
lay in the creative power of individual freedom. And
when the time came to quote the Curtice letter, I read it verbatim:</p>

<p>“I believe,” read the letter, “that the people of this country will
be happy to know that we manufacturers can cooperate in a crisis,
as effectively as we are accustomed to compete in normal times.”</p>

<p>In order to simplify the Pratt and Whitney problem, we had
taken certain decisions with respect to standardizing our line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
engines. First of all, we had definitely scrapped the abortive liquid-cooled
program and had ceased to produce certain air-cooled models.
With this behind us, we now faced a critical situation that threatened
to negate some of our efforts along this line. Back in the late ’thirties,
Bill Patterson, president of United Air Lines, had asked us to assist
him by making a study of a completely new airplane, capable of
coast-to-coast flight with two stops en route, and having such economic
characteristics as would make it a great advance in air transportation.</p>

<p>We had studied the problem along the lines followed in developing
the Pan American Clipper series, and had forced ourselves to
conclude that we would need an engine somewhat larger than our
popular 1830. The airplane would be a four-engined job carrying
approximately forty passengers and would, at current rates for
mail pay and passenger fares, be very attractive to all the airlines.
We had recommended to “Pat” that he turn the study over to one
of the established airplane companies with plenty of experience in
producing transports. Pat had interested Don Douglas in the project,
and Don had brought the other airlines into the picture with
the idea of making the airplane a joint project. One ship had been
built but when no production orders were forthcoming, and the
armed forces had shown no interest, the project had lain idle.</p>

<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Army had issued orders
to halt all production of transports, a mandate that was revoked only
after a Congressional delegation had intervened. Later, in a quick
turnabout, the Army tried to take over the airline transport system
intact. Yet even after it had absorbed nearly half of the airplanes in
service, along with a large number of key men, the commercial airlines
stepped up their plane utilization to the point where they were
carrying more passengers than ever before but with half the equipment.
On January 19, 1942, the Navy organized the Naval Air
Transport Service, or NATS, and on June 1, the Army followed
with the Air Transport Command, or ATC. Out of the confusion
as to the functions of air transport, these two military services
emerged to become indispensable to the prosecution of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>After this, the Douglas four-engined transport project was revived
and rushed into volume production. Almost overnight, Army
and Navy C-54’s, and the commercial version, DC-4’s, began winging
all over the world to carry important people and critical materials
to meet desperate situations. Now as this service expanded, it
hurdled the submarine blockade and became in fact the safest
means of transport, as well as the most expeditious. Of all the various
world services, that across the Himalayan Hump became the best
known, but the over-all performance of the military air-transport
services and the commercial operators was so outstanding as to lead
to the conviction by many that economic air transport had arrived.</p>

<p>In United Aircraft, we lived in mortal terror of a sudden cessation
of hostilities which, like that following the Armistice, would
lead to disorderly reconversion, and the extinction of the private
aircraft-manufacturing industry. For by now we were blown up
so far beyond any size warranted by our own resources or possible
for postwar production that we could not possibly survive the
deflation. As a hedge against this debacle, we decided our only
recourse was to build new engines as the basis for new and more
economical commercial aircraft which would replace the war-surplus
DC-4’s and put the airlines in position to make money under
peacetime conditions. In face of the feeling of certainty among our
engineers that they just could not undertake any further developments
with their current war load, management took responsibility
for the decision and we set up the project.</p>

<p>With a view to strengthening our research division we made a
number of changes. Frank Caldwell moved over from Hamilton-Standard.
My old friend Dr. Lucke, now retired from active teaching
but very much alive to new developments, joined John Lee on a
consulting basis. To utilize the experience and facilities of scientific
institutions, we farmed out numerous research projects pertaining
to jet propulsion. As a final accomplishment, we enlisted the help of
Charles A. Lindbergh.</p>

<p>After President Roosevelt had refused Lindbergh’s offer to serve
in the Army, rugged old Henry Ford had taken him on as research<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
assistant in Detroit. Here Lindbergh, now fortyish, carried out some
very high altitude research under conditions that would have tried
the skill of the ablest young pilot. I wanted him in United as a
personal aide to help resolve some of the conflicts in the latest revolution
in aviation, jet propulsion. Aside from his unexcelled knowledge
of aviation and his proved pilot’s skill, Lindbergh had the
clear incisive mind which we needed so badly in appraising some
of the implications of jet power.</p>

<p>For jet propulsion was not quite so simple as the art of building
piston engines; such problems as air-cooled versus liquid-cooled or
in-line engines versus radials belonged in the kindergarten compared
with the complexities of turbo-jet versus turbo-prop. And
whereas our air-cooled radials had promised improvement in every
factor pertaining to aircraft propulsion, these jets suffered the
serious handicap of profligate fuel consumption at the moment when
maximum range was a fundamental requirement for air tactics and
commercial air transport.</p>

<p>While Lindbergh’s sound judgment proved valuable in this role,
it was back in his natural character as the Lone Eagle that he went to
town for me. On a trip to the Pacific, made at my suggestion with a
view to helping the Vought Corsair play its lawful part in carrier
operations, Lindbergh flew with a squadron of Army Lightnings
on a long-range over-water mission. During this period of island
hopping, advances were restricted to the operating radii of escorting
fighters. Charles Lindbergh, utilizing some of the savvy that had
shown the way from New York to Paris, was able to stretch his own
range some five hundred miles. Following his quiet example, the remaining
squadrons were soon able to go and do likewise.</p>

<p>He dropped in unobtrusively one day on some marine fighter
squadrons left behind to harass by-passed Jap installations on
adjacent islands. The marines were accustomed to strafing Jap positions
with the guns and light bombs of their Corsairs. Lindbergh
quietly constructed a bomb rack for heavy bombs and progressively
increased his load from 1000 to 2000 pounds and finally to 3000-pound
bombs. When the marines discovered that the Corsair was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
truly a heavy dive bomber, they demanded a chance to participate
in carrier-based close-support operations for amphibious forces.
On receipt of this news, the Navy “discovered” the Corsair—so
much so in fact that Adm. J. S. McCain, who had earlier confirmed
current opinion that Corsairs were too big for carriers, now charged
me with losing the war because Vought deliveries were inadequate
to his needs over the Japanese island of Honshu.</p>

<p>At home a new threat appeared. A rumor ran like wildfire through
the shop that Senator Truman’s War Investigating Committee had
discovered evidence of fraud in the inspection department of the
Wright Aeronautical plant at Cincinnati, and was on the way to
investigate. Almost immediately, the news headlines confirmed the
story and the fat was in the fire. The reaction on Wright was
practically to halt production; at Pratt and Whitney it threatened
serious reductions in output, just at the time when demand was
at its highest.</p>

<p>The matter of the inspection on a production line is one of its
most delicate factors. No specifications or instructions can be written
without leaving an element of judgment to an inspection department.
All that is needed to freeze up the whole process is the
threat of Congressional inquiry, especially when accompanied, as
was this case, by jail threats for the guilty parties.</p>

<p>The investigation ran its customary course in the newspapers. The
Committee had its innings. No crime was discovered that had warranted
such a complete shutdown on deliveries of vital war materials.
And after it was over, the manufacturers all over the country picked
themselves up out of the gutter and went on with their production.</p>

<p>In light of the production miracles performed by private industry
in spite of a militantly unfriendly administration, it is interesting,
even though futile, to speculate what might have been done under
an inspired leadership that had faith in the cooperative process,
understood the technique of the voluntary method, and was determined
to give it a friendly opportunity to perform. From the point
of view of costs alone, results would have been startling. The impact
on the human spirit would have been far-reaching. Too many of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
functioned under little more inspiration than that associated with
pride in craftsmanship. I had witnessed the magic that can be worked
by inspiring leadership while under Admiral Beatty’s command in
the Grand Fleet. As World War I dragged to a close, two facts had
become clear. Despite all the bloody trench warfare along the
Western Front, victory would again rest with the nation which held
command of the sea. In the existing stalemate, with the Hun unwilling
to risk action, ultimate victory would crown the head of the fleet
commander who displayed the best leadership; it was all a matter of
morale.</p>

<p>It is now part of history that Beatty, himself a hard-riding fox
hunter, succeeded in bringing his command to the peak of its fighting
efficiency at the precise moment German sailors selected to mutiny.
I had got an insight into Beatty’s mind one day just prior to the Armistice
when he had called me aboard the <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> to compliment
me on some verses I had published in <em>The Arklight</em>, our ship’s
paper, under the title, “When the Grand Fleet Goes to Sea.” On the
settle before the open coal fire in his cabin, Admiral Beatty summed
up a discourse on leadership.</p>

<p>“I appreciate the tribute in your verses,” he had said, “because
morale is the first responsibility of the leader and my every conscious
and subconscious act has been directed toward maintaining high
morale here in the fleet.”</p>

<p>As United Aircraft spilled over into every vacant loft in the Hartford
area and then expanded into huge satellite plants in Connecticut,
Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, morale became my first responsibility.
In order to indoctrinate our many new supervisors in our underlying
philosophies, we organized seminars and conducted classes
in leadership. In these I personally made it clear that United management
had no faith in “shovership”; we would stand or fall on leadership.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the anteroom to the office of the Secretary of the Navy, Fred
Rentschler and I waited our turn. A stream of visitors, mostly naval
officers of high rank, swept in and out of the sanctum. The men who
were furnishing the leadership for this war were contemporaries
of mine back in those brave days at the turn of the century when Pax
Britannica still reigned and when the chances for professional advancement
or even a career looked slim indeed. Now as they moved
in and out, many paused to greet us and say a word of congratulation
on our industry’s production miracle. Meanwhile, we wondered
what the secretary might have in store for us.</p>

<p>Jim Forrestal sat behind his desk, taking a telephone call. As we
took chairs in front of him, I glanced around at the flag-draped room
and its collection of trophies. Jim had made a bid to refurnish the
long room, decorating the walls with blow-up photos and seagoing
mementos but even a powerhouse like Jim could not dispel the musty
odor of the temporary structure or paint out its shabbiness. By 1945
that collection of shacks had served twenty-five years and seen two
world wars, and it bid fair to go on indefinitely. Jim hung up the
telephone, flicked a switch to his “intercom-squawker,” barked a
sharp order at the answering voice, and then turned to us.</p>

<p>James Forrestal, like Fred Rentschler, was a Princeton man.
Curious how you can spot the stamps of Yale, Harvard, Princeton,
Dartmouth, and other Ivy League colleges. Schools like this leave as
much of an imprint upon their alumni as do West Point and Annapolis.
Jim was a close-knit, clean-cut, youngish fellow, dark-complexioned,
with the muscles of an intercollegiate boxer bulging
around his shoulders and upper arms. A man of few words, he
packed almost as much meaning in them as did Fred Rentschler.</p>

<p>“I am going to tell you fellows something, now,” he began, “and
if you repeat it, I’ll deny I ever said it.” He paused to pull open the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
upper left-hand drawer of the desk and remove a packet of gum.
After offering us some, he wadded the wrapper of his own piece,
flicked it into the wastebasket, and went on.</p>

<p>“You fellows are swamping us with your production,” he said.
“Engines, propellers, and airplanes are running out of our ears. The
time has come to slow down.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t resist a crack. “So it’s now ‘too much and too soon.’”</p>

<p>Fred Rentschler looked serious.</p>

<p>“Jim,” he began, “that remark of yours gives us the opening we
have been waiting for. We have been worried about the same thing
for some time, but with the criticism that has been leveled at us,
we just didn’t think it was time to bring the matter to you.” He
lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Of course you know,” he said, “that the aircraft industry has
been blown up like a balloon. Our present output is all out of proportion
to our own meager resources. If there should be a sudden
cessation of hostilities, as in World War I, and that seems highly
probable, and if no more preparation has been made for such an
event than now exists, the whole aircraft industry will be wiped
out in a matter of days. If any company could survive such a catastrophe,
it would be United Aircraft, for we have been ultraconservative
and taken every possible precaution against just this contingency,
but I promise you even United would go out like a
light.” Jim Forrestal sat silent, watching Fred as he went on.</p>

<p>“We have made a quick study of our own situation,” he said,
“and concluded that, upon the sudden termination of existing war
contracts, which under the law occurs immediately upon the cessation
of hostilities, we could not complete the mechanics of paying
off our employees in time to prevent liquidating our resources.
The pay roll is so big,” he added, “and the job of paying off is so
complex, that the outgo would break us before we could finish the
task.” He paused.</p>

<p>“To sum up our position,” he concluded, “the disorderly reconversion
that seems sure to follow this war will wipe us out even
more completely than it did after the Armistice. In our opinion,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
he added, “it’s up to you military fellows to do something about it.”</p>

<p>Jim Forrestal nodded. “I go along with you,” he said, “up to the
last statement. There is nothing the Army and Navy can do about
this. We are public servants and, even under Franklin D. Roosevelt,
subject to the people’s will. The only people that can do anything
about it,” he added, “are you men. Your industry has got to carry
its story to the public.” Again his telephone rang; again Jim handled
the call. He turned back to us.</p>

<p>“Your industry,” he went on, dead-pan, “is the choicest collection
of cutthroat competitors in the country. Maybe it’s because pioneers
still manage it. But if you pioneers expect to survive,” Jim went on,
“the industry must unite and do battle for its existence. Frankly,
I doubt if anyone can unite the aircraft industry, but someone has
got to try it.” He glanced my way.</p>

<p>“If anyone can do it,” he added, putting a finger on my knee,
“you can.”</p>

<p>He might as well have landed a fist on my chin. What he meant
was that having come out of the Navy, and escaped the early personal
rivalries, I was freed of a handicap.</p>

<p>Even as Jim had talked, orderlies had entered the room and begun
shifting chairs, lining them up in an arc around the secretary’s desk.
Through the open door I caught glimpses of the uniforms and gray
thatches of ranking department heads, standing by for a council
meeting. As Fred and I stood up to leave, Jim walked us to the
door.</p>

<p>“Why not stay for the council meeting?” he asked me, as we shook
hands. “You’ll see a lot of old shipmates.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” I replied, “I guess we’d better go home and digest
what you’ve just told us.”</p>

<p>Back in Hartford, the four members of United’s war council gathered
around the long table in the board room where Fred Rentschler
had his office. On the walls hung the portraits of men who had
helped make the company—men like Chance Vought, George
Wheat, George Mead, and Don Brown.</p>

<p>After discussing the problem Jim Forrestal had put up to us, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
agreed that this new responsibility would require rearrangement
of our own topside organization. An effort to organize the aircraft
industry for a public relations effort just didn’t fit in with the
detailed administration of any single company. I would have to
relinquish my job as chief executive.</p>

<p>And so I came face to face with the decision that I had known to
be inevitable the moment Jim Forrestal put the finger on me. I had
been in at the inception of Pratt and Whitney and United Aircraft.
I had managed three of its four divisions and participated in
vital decisions as to the other. I had helped hold it together in the
trying days following the Black and Nye investigations, and had
been its chief executive through the critical phases of the war expansion.
Now that we were over the hump, I would have to give up
my cherished title of president in order to try to help the company
to survive.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we had long discussed the possibilities of a
reorganization following the war. We well knew that the reconversion
job would try the nervous and physical capacity of a man
younger than any of us four seniors, and that our duty to the company
demanded that we start bringing juniors along. We four
would graduate into the category of elder statesman while my successor
took over the reins. The logical man was Jack Horner, of
Pratt and Whitney. Ray Walsh and I would fleet up to vice-chairmen
and Jack in due course would become president. Meanwhile I
would assume responsibility for “general-industry” matters and
retain supervision of research. Jack would take over operations, and
Fred would continue to exercise authority over the business affairs
of the company. Ray Walsh, who had a unique capacity for
handling policy, personnel, and legal matters, would continue on
his course.</p>

<p>With these decisions reached, we began a discussion of the course
to be followed in getting our story before the public. Had there
been some independent aviation organization capable of doing the
job, we should have looked to them, but under the circumstances,
it seemed clear that we must depend upon our trade association,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce, in Washington. The war
production councils, then functioning effectively, would automatically
disband upon cessation of hostilities; the Aeronautical Chamber
must be rejuvenated.</p>

<p>Discussion of the course to be followed brought out a key suggestion
by Raycroft Walsh. Ray had been in the Air Corps in
Washington during the Moffett-Mitchell dogfight and had participated
in the hearings before the Morrow Board. Having in mind
the constructive influence of the Board, he now suggested that we
campaign for a new public air policy commission.</p>

<p>Fred Rentschler rather pooh-poohed the suggestion but, when I
supported it, finally agreed wholeheartedly. Here was a little indicator
of how difficult it might prove to sell the idea to the company
presidents; if Fred Rentschler needed selling, how about the others
less profound in their mental processes than he? We now decided
that I should make a swing around the circuit to appraise the states
of mind and try to plant the idea before we committed ourselves
irrevocably to changes in our own organization that our directors
might not approve. On our board, aside from the principal officers
of the company, we had enlisted the help of several distinguished
“outside directors.” Joseph P. Ripley, president of the New York
investment house of Harriman Ripley, had been active in the original
incorporation of United Aircraft and Transport. Harry G. Stoddard,
president of Wyman Gordon, had long served on our executive
committee. Morgan B. Brainard, president of Aetna Life
and Affiliated Companies, was a man of broad wisdom and wide
business experience. Francis W. Cole, a prominent Hartford lawyer
and later board chairman of the great Traveller’s Insurance Company,
brought us mature counsel. Mr. Peter M. Fraser, later president
of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, completed
our coterie of able men. And if at times the technicalities of
our business confused them somewhat, nonetheless, their unexcelled
fundamental business knowledge was a priceless asset to the company.
We outlined the plan to them but decided to defer final decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
until I could check industry sentiment and determine if the
Forrestal suggestion could command its support.</p>

<p>This check took me westward to Los Angeles, the center of the
air-frame section of aircraft production. As our representative in
that territory, Russell R. Vought, younger brother of Chance
Vought, had long maintained an office in Beverly Hills. Russ had
gone west while still a young man, and founded his own business
in San Francisco. Then back in 1928, when we had equipped the
<em>Langley</em> with the new Corsairs, and especially the single-float amphibians,
he had agreed to represent Chance Vought Aircraft on
the West Coast on a part-time basis. Now he made his home in
Beverly Hills and had a bungalow in Palm Springs. Arrived in
Beverly Hills, I called up John G. Lee, the manager of the West
Coast War Production Council, and asked him over to the office
with a view to getting his appraisal of the problem.</p>

<p>John Lee, through his close association with the presidents of the
West Coast companies, was able to give me an authoritative estimate
of the sentiment out there. The presidents, he thought, were
too much engrossed with their own immediate problems to become
interested in the long-term difficulties. They were aware of
the threat to survival but not as yet concerned with it. Like many
other business chief executives, they were groggy and punch-drunk,
and you couldn’t blame them. As a reward for their pains they had
found themselves characterized as munitions racketeers, war profiteers,
and merchants of death. Now, through production miracles,
they had given the lie to their detractors. The profit motive no
longer provided an incentive to creative endeavor.</p>

<p>“Take Mr. Douglas, for instance,” John summed up. “He is the
key to the West Coast situation. If you could enlist his support, you
could also get the help of the others; without it you’d be licked
before you started. <cite>Time</cite> magazine recently quoted him as saying
he had the perfect postwar plan: ‘lock the door and throw away the
key.’ Of course Mr. Douglas didn’t say that, even though he may
have thought it, but the quote is significant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Ever since that day in Jim Forrestal’s office, I had been mulling
over an idea evolved one evening at Admiralty House, Bermuda,
where my wife and I had been the dinner guests of Vice Adm.
Sir Charles E. Kennedy-Purvis, RN, K.C.B., Commander in Chief
of British Forces in the Western Atlantic. As Comdr. Charles E.
Kennedy-Purvis, Executive Officer of the light cruiser <em>Southampton</em>,
I had known him well in the old Grand Fleet days. “K-P,” as
we called him, had recently been advised of his pending assignment
as First Deputy Sea Lord, at the Admiralty, London, where he
would be charged with responsibility for recreating the British
carrier force after the decline suffered under the Air Ministry. He
had asked us down for a visit in order to get my slants on the principles
involved.</p>

<p>My idea had first come to me the evening following the German
surrender in World War I when several of us wardroom officers
had gone ashore to pay a social call on K-P and his wife in their tiny
apartment over a cottage in the village of Limekilns. Upon my
referring to Beatty’s congratulatory signal to the Grand Fleet, K-P
had taken pains to remind me that the message had been addressed
to the British Empire.</p>

<p>“Beatty,” he had said, “was not talking to the fleet but reminding
the people that it had been the nine-knot tramps, the rusty colliers,
the huge transports, the drifters and trawlers, all the ‘Merchant Men’
which had kept the Empire lifeline open. These,” he had added, “are
the backbone of our sea power.”</p>

<p>K-P, who like most English officers was much better schooled in
public affairs than were we, had gone on to give us a discourse on
transportation. From the days of the aborigines’ pursuit of game
herds, the progress of civilization was marked by the milestones of
the development of transport. In America, the railroads had sparked
reconstruction after the Civil War by opening up the resources of
the West. Following the World War, the automobile would likely
perform the same function. Improved transportation had always increased
the number of persons who could subsist on a given area and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
had always increased the wealth and living standards of lands in
which it had been exploited.</p>

<p>When I had inquired what future K-P foresaw for the airplane
he had shaken his head.</p>

<p>“The economics of the thing are all against it,” he had replied.
“The cost and complication of the airplane are out of all proportion
to its limited useful load.”</p>

<p>Subsequently, with the coming of age of air transport, I had begun
to visualize an analogy between sea power and air power, a line of
thinking that had led naturally to Pax Britannica and Pax Aeronautica.
About this same time John W. Donaldson published a paper
on the same subject. This would become the keynote of the aircraft
manufacturing industry’s struggle for survival, but first we must
establish a wholly new definition of air power. Instead of its being
synonymous with air force, the term must incorporate such other
elements as aircraft production, airline transport, private flying,
finance, public support, in fact everything that helps make a nation
strong in the air. While advocating the preservation of our industry,
we must predicate the need upon the public interest.</p>

<p>When I outlined this idea to John Lee, his eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>“It will take an idea like that to interest Don Douglas,” he said.
“Remember,” he advised, “Mr. Douglas responds to the eye rather
than to the ear.”</p>

<p>In order that we might concentrate on this job, the Voughts now
suggested that my wife and I join them at their cottage on the
desert. Here at Palm Springs, the task was to do a sort of Mahan
analysis of air power in history, and boil it all down to the simplest
terms. After a lot of head-scratching, pencil-pushing, and earnest
discussion, I finally got it in form.</p>

<p>Feeling now the need for the best possible counsel on this important
matter, I wangled an invitation from Rear Adm. John H.
Towers, then on duty at Pearl Harbor, and hopped out to Honolulu
in a Pan American Boeing Clipper that left San Francisco before
supper and arrived at Pearl before breakfast next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>Curiously enough, Jack had as his guest a young English lieutenant
commander of the Royal Naval Flying Service, who had been sent
out by my friend K-P to observe American carrier operations.
After two decades, he was doing the Godfrey de Chevalier act in
reverse.</p>

<p>During my two-day visit at Pearl Harbor, Chester Nimitz, Commander
in Chief, entertained at a luncheon for his top commanders
who had been called in by air for briefing on the next operation,
and he invited me to join the party. As I sat down, the single civilian
in a galaxy of top brass, I estimated that the average number of gilt
stars among thirty-odd officers must be about two and a half per
man. These fellows, all either contemporaries at Annapolis or men
with whom I had been shipmates prior to leaving the Navy, had
fought through two world wars and participated in world events
none had even remotely foreseen.</p>

<p>After a review of my program with Jack Towers and Forrest
Sherman, the latter now Nimitz’s planning chief, I caught the Clipper
back to San Francisco. We had a full load, top brass returning
to Washington and young bluejackets returning home on top priority
because of illness in their families or other personal difficulties.
Arrived back at Beverly Hills in time for lunch, I called Don Douglas
on the telephone, and made a date with him for the morrow.</p>

<p>As our company car pulled up at the entrance to Don’s plant in
Santa Monica, the California sun shown on the camouflaged village,
which so completely concealed the sprawling plant that it was
hard to find the gate. Don sat behind the desk in the shadow of his
lightproof and soundproofed ground-floor office, and stood up to
greet me as I came in. After a few words to state my business, I
handed him his copy of the air-power statement and as Don sat
down to read it, I opened my copy with a view to pacing his reading.
Don Douglas read carefully, noting every word.</p>

<p>“I’ll go for this,” he said simply, speaking in the soft voice that
made it difficult to hear him at times. Then after a moment he
added, “What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>I explained the need for a meeting of our Aeronautical Chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
of Commerce at which the board of governors should adopt the
program. We must reorganize the Chamber and give it a set of
officers who could direct the program; I suggested that he become
chairman of the board of governors. He countered with the statement
that this job should be mine, but agreed to accept the vice-chairmanship
of the board. I suggested that we borrow John G.
Lee from the West Coast Aircraft War Production Council to
head up the reorganization of the chamber and, after some consideration,
he agreed. We would bring in Clyde Vandenburgh, of the
East Coast Council, and Frank Russell, of the National Council, to
assist. A meeting of the National Council was scheduled to take
place in Los Angeles late in April, 1944, which would be attended
by all the company presidents. We would call a simultaneous meeting
of the Chamber and put the air-power program before the
Board for consideration at that time.</p>

<p>On April 26, 1944, the board of governors of the Aeronautical
Chamber of Commerce met in Los Angeles. In presenting the
program, still in its tentative typewritten form, I pointed out that
this was a preliminary statement and subject to revision by the
members. After all, the Constitution of the United States had been
no one-man job but the painstaking effort of many men of different
minds; we needed the thoughts of everyone on what would prove
an important action by the board. A number of constructive suggestions
were offered and voted, after which the revision was
adopted unanimously. The preamble to the resolution ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The Board of Governors of the Aeronautical Chamber of
Commerce of America, in order to “provide for the common
defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings
of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity,” and in order to
ensure that the airplane which America created shall be used
to maintain peace and secure the blessings of peace to mankind,
does unanimously recommend the early formulation of
an American Air Power Policy under the following guiding
principles:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>And the essence of these principles was summarized toward the
end of the pamphlet in this paragraph.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The public character of aviation imposes upon it a dual
role. Commercial companies, to advance their private interests
and stimulate technical progress, must compete in the realm of
operations. At the same time, they must collaborate in the
realm of policy to promote the public interest.</p>
</div>

<p>We had naturally expected that when this document was released
to the aviation press it would create something of a stir, but
in this we were disappointed. After this warning that the idea would
need to be sold, even to aviation writers, we began to appreciate
the fact that we had a job on our hands. Through Deac Lyman, an
old <cite>New York Times</cite> reporter, we were invited to lunch with
Arthur Sulzberger and his editors in the executive dining room of
the Times Building, where we briefed our situation. The <cite>Times</cite>,
always alert to aviation matters, subsequently covered aviation news
and handled aviation editorials against the background of the policy.
The magazine <cite>Aviation</cite>, whose editor, Leslie Neville, was author
of numerous books on aviation, caught the new spirit and developed
the theme. Soon all the members of the Aviation Writers’ Association
took a hand in developing the broad background of air power
as a trinity of commerce, industry, and security.</p>

<p>Subsequent events proved that we had acted none too early.
Within a matter of weeks, we were haled before a Congressional
investigating committee, the War Contracts Subcommittee of the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_THIRTY">CHAPTER THIRTY<br>
Toward Public Inquiry</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Having developed a certain gun shyness before such Congressional
inquiries as the Nye inquisition and the air-mail investigation conducted
by Senator Hugo Black, now Mr. Justice Black of the
United States Supreme Court, we air craftsmen might have shied
away from Senator Murray save for a bit of sage advice given me
by Mr. Sam Rayburn, then Speaker of the House. When I called
on him for counsel as to how we should proceed with our air-power
program, the Speaker offered it as his opinion that we should avoid
lobbying as we would a plague. All trade associations were suspect;
they usually devoted their energies to the search for special
advantage for their clients. And the munitions business was condemned
out of hand. Besides, that was the wrong way under any
circumstances. Congressmen, the Speaker assured me, were just
average people, no wiser, no dumber than anyone else. But there
was one thing a Congressman had to understand if he wanted to
stay in politics, and that was the will of the people. He thought we
had a good case for public approval in our air policy, and he advised
following Jim Forrestal’s advice and taking it direct to them.</p>

<p>He thought one of the best ways to get our story to the public
was to appear at the public hearings held by Congressional committees.
These, according to the Speaker, were good sounding boards
from which to beam your point of view. Besides, you might actually
influence a committee if you had an especially strong case.
But it was a mistake to send lawyers or staff members of an association
to these hearings. The company presidents should appear themselves;
they were more convincing, and Congressmen liked to look
them over. They respected men who had won their spurs in competition,
especially if they also knew how to stand up and speak
their pieces.</p>

<p>“Don’t send a boy,” the Speaker concluded, “to do a man’s work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>By the middle of 1944, with the outcome of the war no longer in
doubt, men began worrying about postwar and the inevitable letdown
of peace. Nation-wide unemployment was taken for granted,
and what to do about it became a live political issue. The aircraft
industry, now one of the largest industries in the history of the
world and one wholly dependent upon an inflated demand for war
materials, seemed headed for the biggest bust imaginable.</p>

<p>And while this was a problem of national interest, it had its focus
in Southern California. Thousands of people had left their homes
and jobs and migrated toward the setting sun there to do their
several bits and incidentally enjoy the climate. Almost immediately,
public officials sensitive to the reactions of the working class began
proposing legislation to meet the problem; a ticket back home
for the dispossessed worker and six months’ unemployment compensation
were widely advocated. The fact that high wages had
been paid them and that the thrifty could probably take care of
themselves seemed to have been lost in the shuffle.</p>

<p>Looking back on this situation now, we can see how completely
wrong the forecasts were. Most of those workers, having basked in
the California sunshine, had already determined to settle there and
could not have been driven out by an air raid. Their newly acquired
mechanical skills would find ready employment in new
industries. The war demand and the “total war” policy had drained
all the pipe lines of consumer goods while the cold fear of the
’thirties had frozen the investment market and stopped the normal
expansion of housing, plant construction, and so on. What the
country really faced was a pent-up demand that would lead to a
postwar boom, and a dearth of labor. The automotive industry,
for instance, could expect to reconvert to a demand of unprecedented
proportions; the aircraft industry, on the other hand, would
face an overwhelming war surplus. The problem that faced the
country was not that of unemployment; the real job was to keep
alive a remnant of vital defense industry.</p>

<p>But this was not the problem before the War Contracts Subcommittee
of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
chairman, Senator James E. Murray, of Montana. “Full employment”
was the war cry of that era, and the C.I.O. echoed it through
the halls of Congress. Full employment, it appeared, was the right
of every citizen, and the government must guarantee it to him
whether he wanted to work or not. Some industrialists applied similar
thinking to their corporations; the idea of government-guaranteed
corporate social security had prompted the creation of the
NRA and the formulation of its monopolistic codes. Now labor
unions on the one hand and trade associations on the other vied with
each other in bringing pressure to bear on Congress to relieve them
from the necessity for struggling to survive.</p>

<p>And so when Senator Murray extended us an invitation to appear
at a hearing to be held on July 10, 1944, we decided to conform
with the Speaker’s advice. The C.I.O. had tipped its hand
in a circular distributed in advance, castigating aircraft manufacturers
as profiteers who had averaged as high as 3,000 per cent
on war contracts. Since we manufacturers were scheduled to make
the first appearance and be followed by the C.I.O., it was a fair
guess that we had been selected as whipping boys.</p>

<p>And so our association, using the air policy as its bible, prepared
its case with a special slant at this matter of war profits. We divided
our presentation into four parts, with a separate witness for
each. I was to make the general introduction of the industry viewpoint,
and submit our statement of air-power policy. J. C. Ward,
president of Fairchild Aviation Corporation and a convincing witness,
was to cover postwar national defense and the aircraft industry.
Harry Woodhead, president of Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft Corporation,
was to discuss the George-Murray bill, manpower demobilization,
contract termination, disposal of war surplus, and reconversion.
Joseph T. Geuting, chairman of the Personal Aircraft
Council of the Chamber, was to discuss the role of personal aircraft
in postwar readjustment.</p>

<p>When the hearing opened in one of the large committee rooms
of the Senate Office Building, the place was crowded and the
press table filled by Washington correspondents attracted by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
C.I.O. handout. Senator Murray sat on the dais while the witnesses
were called to testify from a table at his feet. This layout put the
witness at something of a disadvantage and news photographers
sometimes used it to get worm’s-eye shots of bigshots looking anything
else but. I recalled one taken of a friend of mine in the Black
investigation, and widely used by the press, in which my friend,
who was really a good egg, looked like nothing so much as a praying
mantis.</p>

<p>This inquiry, however, appeared friendly. It wasn’t important
enough to warrant klieg lights or a radio hookup, but attracted the
usual barrage of flash bulbs touched off at the instant best calculated
to catch the witness with his mouth open or his guard
down.</p>

<p>In my extemporaneous introduction, I pointed out to the Committee
that we welcomed this inquiry and especially the Committee’s
interest in postwar unemployment. We had taken the position
early in the war that the government should permit us to
earn enough money on war contracts so that we might discharge
our responsibilities to employees terminated by the cessation of
hostilities. We had had in mind that, by adjusting each case on its
merits, and out of funds set aside from earnings for that purpose,
the employer could handle the problem with fairness to the employee
as well as to the public which, after all, was the customer
in this case.</p>

<p>However, Congress had disapproved that procedure and, through
the excess profits tax, the Price Adjustment Act, the cost inspection
service, and all other controls, had so limited our earnings that
we now had no funds available for the purpose. As a matter of
fact, our companies had been so blown up by war demands that
a sudden cessation of hostilities must inevitably wipe out all our
resources before we could reduce our working forces in any orderly
manner. In short, our problem was not one of war profits; it was
rather a question of how to survive.</p>

<p>But while on the subject of profits, it might be noted that only
recently the National City Bank of New York had printed in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
<cite>Bulletin</cite> an analysis of profits as a percentage of sales of the several
groups of industries doing war work. This report had shown that
the aircraft industry ranked lowest of all industries, with a record of
approximately 1½ per cent. The same table had revealed that the
automotive industry, now busy manufacturing products designed
and developed by the aircraft companies, had earned nearly twice
as much. This fact had resulted from the automotive industry’s
better tax base.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I pointed out, my own company, United Aircraft,
had from the beginning voluntarily stabilized its earnings at a figure
based on the use of its own facilities and resources prior to the
commencement of the United States aircraft production program.
All these figures were, however, quite academic; they were simply
estimated results of current operations based on an assumption that
the war contracts might be terminated in an orderly manner. In the
last war, no such thing had taken place; contracts had been closed
out so brutally that, according to another National City Bank
<cite>Bulletin</cite>, many companies had gone through the wringer and even
the strongest, in the number of some sixty-six representative suppliers,
had been forced to write down their apparent net worth
by approximately one billion dollars, or 50 per cent. Our present
“profit” was therefore but a temporary bookkeeping entry; no
company could even guess where it would come out unless Congress
proceeded with all speed to write new legislation that would
facilitate orderly reconversion.</p>

<p>While I developed this testimony, our staff circulated a summary
of the figures among the men and women at the press table, some
of whom had, no doubt, read the C.I.O. pamphlet charging us
with having made 3,000 per cent. C.I.O. figures showed gross profit
before taxes as a percentage of net worth and, while accurate enough,
manifestly emphasized what wide variations can result from the
mere definition of the naughty word “profit.”</p>

<p>In continuing my testimony, I went on to point out that the aircraft
industry, now the biggest industry, was a vital factor in our
domestic economy and that the public interest as well as the worker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
interest demanded that we not upset the whole national picture
through disorderly or even punitive procedure. By this we did
not mean for a moment that our industry should be subsidized in
any way; we hated subsidy because it tended to throttle technological
progress. We had made rapid strides only because we had had
rough going; in our struggle to exist at all we had been forced to
conceive and create devices that would otherwise have never seen
the light of day. What we asked of the government was that it
make up its mind as to what it needed and then let us go back to
cutting each other’s throats in that exciting way which had kept
United States technology in the forefront of world progress.</p>

<p>At this remark, I noted a stir among the newsmen and women;
long accustomed to hearing special pleaders demand special privilege,
they were taken aback by the aircraft industry’s expressed preference
for competition. Such unheard-of conduct was news of the
“man-bites-dog” variety.</p>

<p>From this beachhead I went on to urge the appointment of a
presidential advisory commission on aviation, one like the Morrow
Board of 1925. After reviewing some of the background, I pointed
out the rapid advances in technology since the day of that report,
especially in the key element of air transport. This alone would
seem to warrant a reappraisal of air policy, one based on the new
concept that air power was not a military striking force but a
trinity composed of air commerce, aircraft industry, and the armed
service as well as all the other factors that went to make a country
powerful in the air. All these factors were mutually interdependent
and must be closely integrated if we were to employ our air power
to keep the peace. The need for thinking through a new policy based
on these ideas was obvious; it concerned government, labor, management—all
the elements of the community.</p>

<p>In summing up, I pointed out again that our problem had never
been a matter of profits but one of survival and that survival was
our immediate concern. However, we were confident that, given
an orderly reconversion and the necessary constructive air policy,
air power could become the new reagent for keeping the peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
of the world and better still, through the medium of improved transport,
lead to the era of prosperity so vital to keeping the peace.</p>

<p>Following me, Harry Woodhead gave specific answers to eight
questions propounded by the Committee and concerned with the
industrial and human aspects of demobilization. Speaking in his
clear, strong voice he made a convincing impression. Following
Harry Woodhead, Joseph T. Geuting, Jr., submitted a comprehensive
summary of things necessary to the orderly development
of personal airplanes during the postwar adjustment period. Both
Joe Geuting and Carl Ward, who now followed with his presentation,
had been selected because of their knowledge of their subjects
but even more important because both were good extemporaneous
speakers and both had strong convictions as to the soundness
of the industry policy. Carl Ward especially handled a complex
subject with a knack rare in professional men; he reduced technical
jargon to popular language.</p>

<p>At the close of the day, Senator Murray thanked us warmly for
our constructive approach to the problem. During the sessions of
the following days, Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the
Navy for Air, endorsed the industry stand. Robert P. Patterson,
Undersecretary of War; Charles E. Wilson, executive vice-chairman
of the War Production Board; and representatives of the
U.A.W.-C.I.O. and I.A.M.-A.F. of L. made recommendations
generally in accord with the suggestions of the industry representatives.
The C.I.O. barrage on profits broke down against the record
established by the industry, and Senator Murray himself later introduced
a bill in Congress calling for the appointment of a new
presidential advisory commission, like the Morrow Board. However,
many critical months must pass before such a board would
see the light of day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, press comment on the hearing was favorable and
David Lawrence dug the meat out of the cocoanut in an article
in which he said that the aircraft industry had revealed its postwar
plan to a startled Congressional committee. The industry, he
said, had thought its problem through. And to the surprise of all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
it had not asked for subsidy. It had asked only that the government
make up its mind what it wanted and leave the rest to competition
within the industry.</p>

<p>We drew encouragement from all these events. We knew that
Senator Murray was close to the White House and that his introduction
of the bill implied at least that the President was not unfavorably
disposed to it. For prior to the hearing, Fred Rentschler
and I had taken pains to cover this angle, by making a call on John
W. Snyder. Mr. Snyder had recently come to Washington at President
Truman’s request and was destined to do a statesmanlike job
in many fields for the Truman administration. We found him well
informed on the whole air-power problem and fully prepared to
advise the President on the industry’s plans to bring the matter
before the public. Early in the program we even hoped that the
President might appoint the committee himself, even as President
Coolidge had done, but now to our surprise we found active opposition
in two quarters.</p>

<p>The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Air, William A. M.
Burden, developed no enthusiasm for the idea, and when Don Douglas,
Bob Gross, and I called on him one day, he explained why. He
felt that the existing legislation on the subject of air commerce
was adequate and feared that a protracted public inquiry might
hamper things already in the works and thus retard progress. But
the big complication we faced came from the Army Air Forces.</p>

<p>The ancient Army-Navy rivalry had not died down under the
impact of war but had flared anew and on many fronts. At heart it
was the same old dogfight that had engaged Billy Mitchell and
Billy Moffett twenty years earlier. The Army Air Force still battled
for control of all military aviation, and the Navy scratched
gravel to hang onto its own. Within the industry itself, whatever
might be our private views, we took no position on the matter.
After all it was a private grudge fight between two customers. We
had hoped that the Air Force, now that it had won its battle for
autonomy and demonstrated its decisive character, would welcome
an opportunity to plead its case before a public tribunal. Instead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
it resorted to the same tactics Billy Mitchell had used and thus confused
the whole matter of air-power policy. The fact was that the
Army Air Force, for all the miracles performed by the military air-transport
services—managed as it was by personnel from the commercial
air-transport lines—still remained blind to the significance
of air transport.</p>

<p>In an effort to overcome this resistance we now asked the National
Planning Association to study air power, hoping that this
distinguished organization might support us with a recommendation
for a national air policy board. For the National Planning Association,
a private organization comprising men in all walks of life
and of all shades of opinion had been organized to study just such
problems as ours, namely those of vital import to national policy.
Before a matter could be studied at all it must first be passed upon
by a tough board of trustees who carefully screened out all subjects
not included in its charter. Then after a problem had been accepted
for study, it had to be debated by a selected panel in an
open forum before which the burden of proof lay upon the proponents.
The association finally accepted our request for study
and numerous meetings were held under the supervision of competent
moderators. Some of the labor representatives on the panel were
especially keen, and since the industry’s position safeguarded the
working man and the public as well as the industry, we found ourselves
on the strongest possible grounds.</p>

<p>Our problem lay with some of the many government agencies
on the panel, for aviation concerned a whole flock of such agencies,
many of whom were naturally more concerned with protecting
their vested interests than with advancing the art of aviation as a
whole. Debates before the panel helped us to crystallize our own
ideas and to adjust them to practical circumstances. When, for instance,
the representative of the Director of the Bureau of the
Budget questioned the soundness of our view as to the fundamental
economics of air power, he started me off on an expedition the results
of which startled even our research group.</p>

<p>Having in mind, from my youth in the Northwest, the story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
of the land-grant railroads, I had begun a search for a factual basis
with which to support the air-power theme. I knew that, following
the Civil War, the whole force of the United States government
had been placed behind the expansion of the railroads as a means
of opening up the great West, providing jobs for discharged war
veterans, and developing a vast area of rich territory. To encourage
this expansion the government had given some 180,000,000 acres
of undeveloped land to certain roads and in return had passed legislation
requiring the railroads to rebate to the government a percentage
of the charge for hauling government freight and passengers.
The balance sheet on this project, if one could be found,
might prove interesting to the air-transport situation.</p>

<p>Inquiry among railroad operators disclosed no record of the transaction
and little interest in it, but research in the government records
produced the surprising information that the roads had repaid their
debt to the government however one might figure the original land
values. If the figure selected was $1.00 per acre, the estimate at the
time of the gift, the roads, having at the time of inquiry rebated
some $640,000,000, had paid the debt back threefold. If the figure
selected was $3.00 per acre, a fair average of the selling price the
roads had received for the land, then they had still broken even.
In other words, the government had not subsidized the roads with
this grant; it had made instead a profitable investment. A short
while after this inquiry was made, Congress revoked the land-grant
rebates.</p>

<p>Similar inquiry into the air-mail situation now revealed an even
more startling figure. At the time of the inquiry, the airlines were
still making money. Having lost half of their equipment to the
military air-transport services, and having supplied a large part of
the operating leadership, they had stepped up their utilization of
equipment, and reduced their costs, to the point where they were
earning satisfactory profits from mail and passengers without yet
having exploited the possibilities of air cargo. Had they been “reasonably
regulated” as required by law, they might have continued
their record instead of running into serious losses as they have since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
done. But at the moment of the inquiry, the Post Office Department
could make the proud boast that receipts by the government
from the sale of air-mail stamps alone had already exceeded payments
made to the operators for carrying the mails, even after a
heavy loading of Post Office Department overhead. The United
States government was not subsidizing the airlines with mail pay;
it was taking a nice profit from that operation. Post Office subsidies
were granted for several different classes of mail by palpably
low rates but the special air-mail stamp carried its own freight.</p>

<p>And so, out of the need for justifying our theory of air power,
we discovered the greatest possible justification of it, namely, its
economic soundness. The Post Office Department, like all government
departments subjected to the handicaps of political patronage,
was notoriously uneconomical, yet the air-mail operation could
support a large slice of this excessive overhead and still show the
department a profit on the operation. The railroads argued that the
hidden subsidy of government airports and airways nullified the
arguments, yet there was a long history of similar government support
for highways and waterways. Meanwhile the Post Office subsidized
directly the carriage of periodicals, and took serious losses
on rural delivery and other classes of service. Here was a fact of
profound importance to our air-power program: air mail was already
self-sustaining and if subsequently the situation changed,
losses could not be charged to air mail as such, but must be credited
directly to inept management; that is, government regulation.</p>

<p>This raised the whole question not alone of the reasonableness
of the “reasonable regulation” but also of the principle itself. There
is nothing in the history of the railroads to support the principle;
cutthroat competition could hardly have been more disastrous than
the present regulation. When, earlier, the railroads had found
themselves face to face with the penalties of their own mistakes,
they had sought to lean on government; they had asked for regulation
and they had got it. Of course they had sacrificed their birthright
for a mess of pottage because, having eased the economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
pressure of the struggle to survive, they had removed the chief
incentive to technological development.</p>

<p>This point was admitted by Fred Williamson, then president of
the New York Central, when he and I discussed the matter on
a salmon-fishing trip to Anticosti Island. It had started as a bantering
argument at a time when the New York Central was giving
consideration to a suggestion that the railroad start its own airline.
After I had set forth the case for air transport, Fred Williamson
looked off down the Jupiter River and remarked in all earnestness:</p>

<p>“You know, if the railroads had invested in engineering all the
money they have spent seeking to gain legislative advantage over
motor and air transport, we’d be in a far better competitive position
today.”</p>

<p>This whole matter of “reasonable regulation,” so critical with
respect to a healthy air-transport industry, the key to air power,
was one we had hoped to have studied by our air policy board, but
in that hope we were disappointed. The National Planning Association
issued a fine report on air-power policy, but certain government
agencies blocked its support of our recommendation for the
appointment of a presidential aviation commission. Under the circumstances
we were not surprised when the President withheld
action.</p>

<p>Now since one of the most important questions to come before
a new board must be that of the long-term programs of procurement
for air-force naval and commercial needs, we suggested that
a study of this should be inaugurated. Meanwhile, in order to bring
the many government agencies now concerned with aviation into
some semblance of accord, the President had appointed an informal
group called the “Air Coordinating Committee,” an organization
which included the Assistant Secretaries for Air of the War, Navy,
and Commerce Departments. This committee now initiated a study
by the Harvard School of Business Administration, to determine
the absolute minimum of aircraft production of all types under
which an aircraft industry might exist. Such an industry must, of
course, keep in the forefront of world technological progress and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
be capable of rapid expansion in times of emergency. As the keystone
of air commerce and air forces, the public interest seemed
to require at least a minimum industry. The report, when finally
issued, clearly indicated the vital need for a long-term, continuing
program that would correlate all needs, public and private, and it
specified the size of a minimum program in pounds of air frames
to be built each year.</p>

<p>In order to remove any misunderstanding as to the character of
our association we had earlier changed our name to the Aircraft
Industries Association of America, and to help direct our public-opinion
work, we employed skilled public relations counsel. From
them we learned that one of the first steps in creating public opinion
is to bring your case before writers and speakers everywhere whose
comments and opinions command public respect. One method of
accomplishing this is for industry speakers to address public gatherings,
where writers and speakers are in attendance, and to bring a
message that will command sufficient attention to warrant comment
by the public press. Our air-policy program contained such a
message and it now devolved upon me to carry the message to
Garcia.</p>

<p>Time was, in this land of ours, when public speakers were few
and far between; today they are many and underfoot. When any
organization decides to hold an annual dinner, it must first recruit
a speaker whose name may attract enough customers to help the
dinner committee break even. And since the audience are themselves
all public speakers, they will be less interested in what the
speaker has to say, and more in how he says it; a new technique or
a new story is of unusual interest. Having had no other training in
public speaking than that which goes along with standing in front
of a squad of bluejackets and selling them on hitting the target, my
technique was informal, conversational, and flowing. I might have
memorized and carefully prepared my extemporaneous address,
but I tried not to reveal the fact. And when, after giving my air-power
theme the particular twist that belonged with the particular
audience, some of them came up to congratulate me, I soon discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
that few ever remembered the words, though some recalled
the music. With this in mind, it is often more effective to slant the
speech at the newsmen or the newsreaders; the listening audience
is only waiting to get it over with anyway—even as you and I.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our several companies used their own resources to
carry our story to their own localities where workers and businessmen
were interested in the survival of the enterprise. Some of this,
as Speaker Rayburn had foreseen, percolated back to Washington
whether in the form of resolutions by various farm, labor, or business
organizations, or just by letter or word of mouth. And so, with
the hand of some government aviation agencies against us, we were
encouraged by the reception given us by a group of senators and
representatives who had come to dinner.</p>

<p>At an informal affair arranged to introduce our company presidents
to some of the leaders in Congress on aeronautical matters,
men who had previously known each other by name only, we divided
our guests among small tables at each of which one of our
presidents acted as host. Afterward, we called on our guests to
speak to us and to our surprise found the burden of their discourse
to be something like this: “You fellows have sold the public on air
power, what do you think we ought to do about it?” In reply we
pointed out that the whole problem was too complex for us; neither
we nor anyone else could have the answers. We thought the matter
deserved an airing before a public commission like the presidential
advisory committee of twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Concrete action along these lines was forthcoming at the instigation
of an able senator, Mr. Hugh B. Mitchell, from my native
state of Washington. As chairman of a subcommittee of the Senate
Military Affairs Committee, one that contained a number of outstanding
men, the senator began conducting hearings on the subject.
Our company presidents who appeared before this committee
to present our case were much impressed by the fact that committee
members attended the hearings and took an active interest
in the problem. Before going back home to stand for reelection,
Senator Mitchell introduced a bill calling for the appointment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
a board to be constituted along the lines of the old Morrow Board.
When the senator failed of reelection in the Republican year of
1947, a Democratic colleague, able Senator Brian MacMahon of
my own state of Connecticut, reintroduced the Mitchell bill. Not
to be outdone in courtesy, Republican Senator Brewster of Maine
introduced the Brewster bill, one that differed from the MacMahon
bill in that it provided for a purely Congressional committee.</p>

<p>From this point forward, matters dragged interminably. Most
of us manufacturers, sold on our own doctrine, had now moved
into the design and production of new transport aircraft intended to
replace the war-weary war surplus. In United Aircraft, for instance,
we had undertaken to expand the power output and increase
the dependability of our current commercial engines and had at
the same time inaugurated a wholly new engine, a twenty-eight-cylinder
Wasp Major with a capacity of 4,360 cubic inches and
an initial rating of 3,000 horsepower. This was over three times
the cylinder displacement of the original Wasp but over seven
times the power output, with possibilities of reaching ten times that
output. It was expected to cost ten million dollars for development
alone, or some ten times the original investment in Pratt and Whitney
at the inception of the Wasp production.</p>

<p>Around these new models and the competitive engines under
development by our rivals, Wright Aeronautical, the airplane manufacturers
had gone overboard on new transports designed to carry
increased loads at greatly reduced costs, and at much higher speed.
All these companies appreciated the risks involved, but faith in
the future of air transport justified to them the investment of their
war earnings in the expansion of American air power. And this faith
might have been justified had we been able to bring about the formulation
of a dynamic national air policy, for the designs were sound
in conception and well executed.</p>

<p>But now as time passed without concrete action, both air-transport
and aircraft production drifted into severe difficulties. Save for
a curious chain of circumstances, it is unlikely that the aircraft
industry could have survived the long wait for an air policy board.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Following the resignation of Charles E. Wilson, the great president
of General Electric, from the War Production Board where
he had been a bulwark of strength, and the subsequent departure
of Donald Nelson, Julius Krug became chairman. By that time reconversion
had become a live subject and a young lawyer on Cap
Krug’s staff, Mort Wilner by name, had become much exercised
over the threatened extinction of the aircraft industry. While,
under existing law, cessation of hostilities would automatically cancel
all aircraft-production contracts, a provision in Section 102 of
the Reconversion Act authorized the President to continue such
contracts as could be shown to be clearly in the public interest.
At Mort Wilner’s suggestion I took John E. P. Morgan, able manager
of the association, and called on Cap Krug to suggest that he obtain
in advance a list from the War and Navy Departments of such contracts
as could be shown to be in that category, and hold it in readiness
against an emergency.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that when President Truman returned from
Potsdam, Cap Krug gave John Snyder a letter for the President’s
signature, which John Snyder carried to Norfolk with him. In this
letter addressed to the Secretaries of War and Navy, the President
directed that the specific contracts primarily connected with research
and development be continued in effect. On this slender
thread the aircraft industry subsisted until Congress could make appropriations
for a temporary program.</p>

<p>Meanwhile with both the aircraft manufacturers and the transport
operators hanging on the ropes, a fortunate break occurred. Maj.
Gen. Oliver P. Echols, United States Air Force, returned from duty
with the military government in Germany and asked for retirement.
Oliver had been to the Air Force Matériel Command what Admiral
Moffett had been to BUAERO. Having lacked any interest in personal
publicity, his name was not widely known, but his achievements
had long been recognized by all those in a position to appreciate
them. In a way he was reminiscent of the old aviation story
about Charlie Lawrance, designer of Lindbergh’s Wright Whirlwind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
engine. When asked why he had received so little recognition,
Charlie is reported to have asked, “Whoever heard of Paul Revere’s
horse?” Now Oliver Echols had the qualities required of the president
of the Aircraft Industries Association. He had the respect of
the industry, the Air Force, and the Navy; he knew aviation; he
was familiar with the routine of Washington; he had the respect
of legislators; he was in sympathy with the principles of the association;
and finally, because he had zeal for air power, he was willing
to accept the appointment, though tired by arduous service.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in an effort to crystallize opinion as to air policy,
I had published a book called <cite>Air Power for Peace</cite>, which was issued
early in 1945. Patterned on Mahan’s method, this little book reviewed
the history of aviation and appraised the impact of air power
upon the war. And though history was still in the making and available
only in censored headlines, the conclusions drawn in the book
were later supported by the reports of the postwar Strategic Bombing
Surveys. In light of the extravagant claims that had been made
for aviation, it was necessary to keep the book wholly objective
and, therefore, like Mahan, hard reading.</p>

<p>The outstanding conclusion drawn from this study was the important
place air transport had held in the war. When the sea had
been blockaded by enemy submarines, air transport had retained
freedom of movement. With the Japanese in control of sea communications
to China, air transport had hurdled the Himalayan
Hump. With access by sea to Europe and Africa denied by German
submarines, air transport, even though hastily improvised, had not
only surmounted the barrier, but had become in fact the safest,
cheapest, and often the only means of communication. Important
persons and critical materials were delivered at critical points often
just in time to exercise decisive influence on the outcome.</p>

<p>This fact was the result of the mobility of the airplane. On the
ground, where movement can take place in but two dimensions and
is often restricted by physical obstacles, blockade is relatively simple.
At sea, where movement is still in two dimensions, obstructions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
fewer and blockade is more difficult. In the air, where movement is
three dimensional, and fixed obstructions few, effective blockade
becomes almost impossible. And since freedom of communication is
vital to security, the basic strategy in both war and peace is to guarantee
freedom of communication to one’s self and to deny it to an
enemy. This must be the beginning and end of foreign policy and
the basis of strategy in both war and peace. The actual performance
of air transport in World War II therefore becomes one of the most
vital factors of modern times. By comparison, the atom bomb is a
dangerous explosive; air transport is a new key to economic, social,
and military security.</p>

<p>While writing <cite>Air Power for Peace</cite>, I had been impressed by the
need for presenting this point of view in another manner. In the
case of sea power, Mahan, the historian, had deduced the lessons of
history. But Hakluyt, the author, had helped create the history that
Mahan recorded three hundred years later. Born in England, somewhere
around 1553, Hakluyt had been depressed by the backwardness
of his people. While on a visit to the Temple, his uncle had
shown him a map of the world and had given him “a lesson in
geography,” which had inspired him to “prosecute that knowledge
and kind of literature.” After studying languages so as to be able
to read whatsoever printed or written discoveries and voyages he
found extant in many lands, he made himself acquainted with the
chiefest captains at sea, the greatest merchants, and the best mariners.
Hearing other nations extolled for their discoveries and notable
enterprises, and depressed by the sluggishness of the English and
their neglect of the opportunities afforded them, he undertook to
edit the original journals and narratives with a view to showing that
in sea power lay the means for abolishing squalor and poverty in
England. Today Richard Hakluyt’s <cite>The English Voyages</cite> is one of
the English classics.</p>

<p>Having in mind the possibility of utilizing his method for the air-power
story, I looked around for material. However, Americans
seldom pause to record their observations, as did the explorers and
merchants of the pre-Elizabethan era, and I was forced to fall back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
on my own experience. Fortunately, this had been varied and I had
played in the backfield of a number of Bowl games. The air-power
story might be told from my own point of view.</p>

<p>Decision to undertake this, plus a number of other circumstances,
including a visit to a hospital, prompted me to resign from business.
In order to approach the task objectively, I found it necessary to
detach myself from active operations. Since we had long ago laid
the groundwork for bringing a younger generation into the picture,
nothing seemed to stand in the way.</p>

<p>With the passage of time, the situation in aviation became more
critical. Then at the moment when both air transport and aircraft
production showed staggering losses, we got an unexpected assist
from the Bear That Walks Like A Man. When he began showing
his claws, a great public clamor arose in the United States and was
quickly heard by sensitive Washington ears. Whatever the politicians
may have missed about air power, the American people knew
the answer. On July 22, 1947, the United States Congress passed an
act to provide for the establishment of a temporary Congressional
Aviation Policy Board. Four days earlier, on the eighteenth of July,
the President appointed his temporary Air Policy Commission. The
Congressional Aviation Policy Board, under the chairmanship of
Senator Owen Brewster, of Maine, was made up of senators and
representatives. The President’s Air Policy Commission, under the
chairmanship of Mr. Thomas K. Finletter, consisted of the chairman
and four civilians. Now where we had asked for one investigation,
we got two.</p>

Before the Bar of Public Opinion</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The Finletter Board, convened by the President under date of
July 18, 1947, held extensive hearings and on December 30, 1947,
submitted its report, “Survival in the Air Age.” Like the Morrow
Board before it, the Board comprised able and distinguished men,
including besides its chairman, Mr. Finletter, its vice-chairman,
George P. Baker, and members, Palmer Hoyt, John A. McCone,
and Arthur D. Whiteside. Prior to the Board’s being convened, a
step of far-reaching importance had been taken—the reorganization
of the armed forces and the establishment of the Department
of Defense, under the able leadership of James V. Forrestal.</p>

<p>Prior to this step, the Aircraft Industries Association had inaugurated
an annual conference of its board of governors held in
Williamsburg, Virginia, to provide a forum for the interchange of
ideas among the representatives of industry and those of government
and military services concerned with aeronautics, with a view
to acquainting industry and government with each other’s problems
and responsibilities and to aid in finding solutions to these problems.
At the first conference in 1946, it developed that the Army and
Navy had become concerned over their faulty public relations and
wanted advice and assistance.</p>

<p>Of course their unfavorable press had resulted from the ancient
feud still being carried on in the press by Army and Navy over
the problem of “integration” and “unification.” Behind its façade,
the battle was still the same jurisdictional dispute that had agitated
Admiral Moffett and General Mitchell back in the early ’twenties.
From the industry point of view, the dogfight tended to neutralize
our efforts to develop a public understanding of air power in its
broad aspects, and the board of governors now asked me to confer
with Army, Navy, and Air Force with a view to relieving the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Since the industry had always refrained from participation in
the old feud, this mission posed a problem. To me, the arguments
against the organization of a separate air force had always outweighed
those for it, but I now realized that I had been influenced
against the project by the Army’s insistence on trying to grab off
naval aviation. The record of what had happened in England under
the Air Ministry had always stood out in my mind. But now, with
commercial air transport coming of age, and with the brilliant record
of military and naval air transport in the war, I began to see the
problem in a different light. Air transport had opened up a new
frontier. If the mission of the ground forces was the defense of the
land frontier, and the mission of the seaborne forces was the defense
of the sea frontier, then, logically, the mission of the air force must
be the defense of the air frontier. The key to the problem was the
advent of commercial air transport.</p>

<p>Pursuing this idea further, I came to the conclusion that our
thinking had been confused by two unsound concepts. First, we
had tended to organize the military on the basis of types of weapons
or vehicles, and second, we had looked at the airplane as a weapon
instead of a vehicle. Clearly, if the ground, sea, and air forces were
to be held responsible for the defense of their frontiers, then each
must have the implements essential to the discharge of that responsibility,
and must have full authority over their design, development,
and use. The ground, sea, and air forces must each have
the aircraft necessary to the discharge of their responsibilities. The
air is an ocean that gives uninterrupted access to every corner of
the land and every reach of the sea. The air force is charged with
responsibility for keeping the airlanes open to aerial commerce and
should be provided with the ground or sea transport necessary to
that job, but by the same token the ground and sea forces must develop
and control all the instruments they require to perform their
functions. And aside from the sound basis for this concept that lies
in logic, the record is clear that it is equally sound in practice.</p>

<p>With this idea clarified in my own mind, I called on Vice Adm.
de Witt C. Ramsey, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, and later on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
Gen. Carl Spaatz, Commander, United States Army Air Force, to
sound them out on this concept as a solution to the conflict. In
the Navy, Vice Adm. Forrest Sherman, when called in by Admiral
Ramsey, pointed out that this was the traditional position of the
Navy but that they had been forced to fight to retain their own aviation.
However, Vice Adm. Arthur Radford, the Deputy Chief of
Naval Operations for Air, looked at the matter somewhat differently.
He saw the Naval Air Force as a mobile air force, one, to
quote Admiral Moffett, “able to go anywhere on the backs of the
fleet.” The Army Air Force, anchored as it was, to the ground, was
less mobile. From the Army’s point of view, the vulnerability of the
carrier to submarine attack compromised its usefulness. And here,
I found, lay the nubbin of a great conflict of opinion. For my part,
this difference of opinion was not one to be resolved on theoretical
grounds alone. Our whole experience showed how dangerous it
was to take decisions, especially those involving the national security,
on the basis of prejudice or partisanship. The only safe
course was to pursue both developments with an open mind and be
ready to adapt either or both in support of national policy.</p>

<p>General Spaatz, after our interesting discussion, suggested that
I call on Mr. Stuart Symington, Assistant Secretary of War for
Air, and lay these ideas before him, in the hope of contributing
something to the solution of the ancient dispute. I did so, but was
disappointed. Mr. Symington, recalling my old Navy background,
apparently recognized in me a trojan horse, a partisan bent on dividing
the Army and its Air Force so that the Navy might defeat
both in detail. Wholly unprepared for this novel reception, I was
forced to retire in disorder. As time passed, however, it became clear
that my one-man foray in the role of interservice peacemaking had
not been without result. After my visit with “Duke” Ramsey,
Secretary Forrestal abandoned his opposition to autonomy for the
Air Force and supported reorganization along lines recommended
to him by Ferdinand Eberstadt. That my visit may have helped tilt
the scales in favor of unification is indicated in a letter to me from
Jim Forrestal dated August 4, 1947, in which he said, “Your thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
and mine has had an evolution which has been more or less in phase.”</p>

<p>A few months later, prior to the publication of the report of the
Finletter Board, I discussed with the secretary some of the problems
he faced in his effort to get agreement among the military with
respect to a long-term program for aircraft procurement, development,
and research. He expressed deep concern over the implications
of the many major decisions he was called on to make in areas where
no precedent or experience existed and asked me if I were in a position
to help him.</p>

<p>To men like Jim Forrestal who understood the principles of war,
catch phrases like “strategic bombing” and “unification” aroused
deep concern. The first phrase overemphasized that doubtful tactic
of indiscriminate bombing of nonmilitary objectives, and obscured
the decisive character of such real strategic bombing as the assault on
the Ploesti oil fields which brought German transport to a clanking
halt. The second phrase screened a dangerous drift toward such a national
general staff as had cost Germany two wars. Earnest students,
fearing a dominant Air Force, leaned toward the opposite idea that
the Ground Forces, like the Navy, must control its own air arm.
Civilians like myself hoped to see such fundamental questions of national
policy resolved by an informed public opinion through an air
policy commission, but such was not to be. What might have been
a decisive moment in history proved but another victory for the
Douhet doctrine.</p>

<p>Even though Congress had supposedly integrated the armed
forces by the time the Finletter Commission convened, the interservice
feud raged worse than ever. The Board was unable to draw
from Defense Secretary Forrestal any concrete program for aircraft
procurement; the Chiefs of Staff had not been able to agree on one.
Thus died the first objective of the manufacturing industry’s air-power
program.</p>

<p>However, when the Air Force took the stand before the Board,
Stuart Symington, now its secretary, moved swiftly and decisively
to the attack with a concrete recommendation for a “seventy group”
air force. Out of his forceful presentation came ultimately appropriations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
by Congress which proved to be the salvation of the aircraft
manufacturing industry. Congress, fully alive to the role of the
aircraft industry in national security, was largely motivated by considerations
of preservation of the establishment.</p>

<p>The air-transport people, shoved into the background by superior
showmanship, made a sorry presentation. It had fine leadership in
Adm. Jerry Land, its president, and in two vice-presidents, Bob
Ramspeck and Milton Arnold. But its membership was torn by dissension
over that time-worn conflict, the “chosen instrument.” President
Juan Trippe, whose creation of the great Pan American Airways
system is one of the shining examples of inspired leadership
in private enterprise, favored the policy of a single overseas American-flag
airline, as the only means of competing with foreign,
government-owned, or subsidized air lines. Other operators strongly
opposed this concept as constituting a monopoly, and favored the
system of “reasonable regulation” as practiced with domestic airlines.</p>

<p>This fundamental issue, long bitterly fought behind the scenes,
had previously burst into the open at Chicago during the first meeting
of the International Civil Aviation Conference. The United
States State Department, ably represented by Adolphe Berle, had
fought hard for the “five freedoms,” a modern counterpart of the
old doctrine of freedom of the seas. Against the powerful opposition
of certain foreign governments, notably that of Great Britain, the
United States, weakened by the inner controversy, had been forced
to settle for three of its five freedoms. This same issue now confused
the Air Transport Association’s presentation before the Finletter
Board. On this rock, a second great objective of the inquiry, an investigation
of the reasonableness of regulation, was scuttled.</p>

<p>After exhaustive inquiry, the Finletter Board recommended numerous
improvements as to policy in its report “Survival in the
Air Age.” The Congressional Aviation Policy Board, after waiting
for this report, issued its findings on March 1, 1948, in a joint-committee
print entitled “National Aviation Policy.” But with echoes of
Hiroshima still ringing in the ears of the investigators, air force
displaced air commerce in top billing. The Congressional Board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
held frankly that a strong, stable, and modern civil aviation component
is essential to air power for national security and that domestic
and foreign commerce of the United States should be promoted
by whatever means appear most practical until it reaches
such stature in passenger and cargo capacity as to constitute in a
crisis an adequate logistical arm of the national defense establishment.
In other words, air commerce exists to support the armed
forces. We in the aircraft industry had naïvely insisted that it must
be the other way around. With the Congressional Committee’s
profound observation on the place of civil air transport in air power,
and its denial of the first premise of the aircraft industry’s air-power
policy, we lost our third great objective.</p>

<p>While appropriations for military aircraft served momentarily
to preserve the manufacturing industry and keep the military establishment
from further deterioration, funds were forthcoming only
on a hand-to-mouth basis. So long as Stalin continued pressure on
Europe, Congress would appropriate; the moment he eased up, Congress
would revoke. The essential long-term continuing program so
necessary to technological progress went by the board. Even
Representative Carl Vinson, whose vision had built the Navy of
World War II and whose leadership had implemented the aviation
programs, seemed unable to formalize a program to put into effect
this generally accepted principle. Adding up the results of five years’
effort, the Aircraft Industries Association had to admit failure to
reach its goal. To me the reason was abundantly clear. We had failed
to enlist the cooperation of the armed forces and airline transport
operators under the basic precept of cooperation in public policy
and competition in operations.</p>

The Hand on the Stick</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Early in 1949 the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee
of the Senate, under the chairmanship of Senator Edwin C. Johnson
of Colorado, began inquiring into the ills of the airline transport
industry. Senator Johnson had sat at my table at the dinner given
by the aircraft manufacturers to Congressional leaders in aviation
in Washington some five years earlier. A man well informed on the
whole subject, he now began directing an inquiry that promised
to initiate an important forward step in the formulation of American
air policy. Unlike the Finletter Commission and the Congressional
Aviation Policy Board, both of which had been held under
the overcast produced by the cold front of fear incident to the
Berlin crisis, the Johnson inquiry, following close on the brilliant
success of the Berlin Airlift, focused attention solely on airline transport.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the underlying significance of the Berlin Airlift
was seldom touched upon in the flood of commentary that accompanied
the lifting of the blockade. While it was generally recognized
as a defeat for the Soviet, and served to ease the tensions
and allay the fears of war, the epochal character of the operation
went almost unrecognized. Paul Fisher, in the <cite>Bee Hive</cite>, house organ
for United Aircraft Corporation, in a brilliant article written on the
spot, hailed the victory of air freight. For the first time in world
history, commercial air transports—not combat aircraft—had spearheaded
United States foreign policy in a victorious action against
the swashbuckling Soviet. The very forces which had once reduced
Berlin to rubble with bombs had now saved the population
from starvation with air cargo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, rapid progress in the development of guided missiles
had raised the question of the future of the airplane as a
major weapon carrier. Some strictly military manufacturers had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
already begun giving serious consideration to the problem of
whether to continue to specialize in aircraft or to shift over
to the development of guided missiles. And once experimental
aircraft had exceeded the speed of sound, some began to wonder
if that velocity might not one day mark the division between combat
aircraft and those designed for commercial purposes. In other
words the Johnson Committee began its hearings against the background
of a changing weather map.</p>

<p>Airline testimony before the Committee revealed some wide divisions
within the transport industry itself. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker
for example blamed the ills of the airlines on “too much
coddling and wet nursing,” while Carleton Putnam ascribed them
to “slow starvation.” The individual outlook reflected the color
of the financial statement. And the airline operators, in making their
“policy” recommendations, seldom came to grips with fundamentals
but focused their attentions on revisions of administrative procedure.
In this respect they reflected their long association with
government agencies to whom policy so often means the detailed
management of public affairs rather than a course of conduct. If the
airline operators’ recommendations seemed slanted toward measures
calculated to advance the special interests of their individual companies,
the fact was entirely understandable.</p>

<p>To us aircraft manufacturers who, five years earlier, had covenanted
to cooperate in the public interest where policy was concerned,
while continuing to compete with each other in operations
to our own—and likewise—the public interest, it appeared that a
precarious existence under government economic regulation had
blinded the operators to the broad public interest, and hence, to
their own enlightened self-interest. Leaning on government for a
guarantee of their economic security, they competed with each other
for legislative or administrative advantage, and primarily before
Congressional committees or government agencies. And if some
of them made forays into politics and acted more like rusty railroad
executives than like jet-propelled pioneers, it was in keeping with
the principles under which they operated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>Yet out of the confusion of conflicting testimony it was possible,
by keeping in mind certain fundamentals learned from the history
of aviation, to arrive at certain conclusions. The airline operators
for all their controversies were unanimous on at least two points:
they endorsed the principle of “reasonable regulation” upon which
the Civil Aeronautics Act had been founded, and they condemned
the administration of the Act by the Civil Aeronautics Board.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of the airlines’ unanimous approval of the Act, an
objective study of the testimony raises a serious question as to
its soundness. Sifting out the wheat from the chaff, one could not
help wondering whether Solomon himself, with the aid of all of
his wives, could have administered such a document. Providing as
it does for economic regulation of privately owned industries by
political appointees, the Act flies in the face of the fundamental
fact that politics and economics function under different basic
precepts; in the one the ballot box calls the turn, in the other the
cold arithmetic of an inescapable financial statement. But if the
airlines’ endorsement of “reasonable regulation” proved open to
question, the testimony before the Committee left no doubt that
recent regulation had been, in fact, wholly unreasonable.</p>

<p>It developed that the Civil Aeronautics Board had cut the mail
rates in 1945 to a point well below the actual cost of transporting
the mail. Furthermore it had authorized widespread duplication of
existing services and had subsidized these duplicating services in
competition with those already established. And when this action
resulted in crippling losses, the Board compounded its blunder by
making retroactive increases in mail which had the effect of putting
the whole rate structure on a cost-plus basis. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker,
of Eastern Airlines, voiced the position of the “Big Four”
when he said, “The confused state of mail rates destroys all incentive
for economy and efficiency—it discourages good management and
high performance. It puts a penalty on accomplishment, and rewards
the wasteful and inefficient.”</p>

<p>Another diagnosis of the airline ills was offered by Harold A.
Jones, a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board itself, when speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
before the San Francisco Advertising Club. The airlines, he
thought, were ill from a “mysterious disease known as ‘subsiditis,’”
which disease he ranked “somewhere between bubonic plague and
leprosy.” However his shotgun diagnosis lacked clinical confirmation
before the Senate Committee by his boss, Joseph J. O’Connell,
Jr., chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.</p>

<p>“We are not in a position,” testified Mr. O’Connell, “to give an
accurate estimate as to the amount of the total air-mail pay bill
which represents fair compensation for the carriage of the mail,
and that portion that represents subsidy.”</p>

<p>Postmaster General Donaldson agreed with the Board chairman
and stated that the Post Office had long held the opinion that the
mail rate, if shorn of its subsidy elements, should not in any case
be greater than the passenger rate. On this basis the Post Office
Department would have been credited with approximately one-half
its present transportation expenditures inasmuch as passengers were
paying approximately 50 cents per ton mile, while the Post Office
was paying more than double that amount. This over-all figure, of
course, obscured the wide variations between the compensations
paid airlines thought to be self-sufficient and the much larger payments
to those known to be heavily subsidized.</p>

<p>In the absence of even the most elementary data it is difficult to
see how any regulation could be called reasonable or how the government
could support any subsidy charge either against the industry
as a whole or against any segment of it. The situation was
further obscured by the Postmaster General’s estimate of the total
domestic and foreign air-mail subsidy for this year.</p>

<p>Using the excess of the cost of the service to the Post Office Department
over the department’s air-mail revenues, he arrived at the
figure of $35,000,000. The cost to the department included of
course all expenses allocated to air mail including department overhead,
but it did not substantiate the reasonableness of any allocation.
Under questioning by one of the senators of the Committee,
this all inclusive definition of “subsidy” was discounted. Under
business accounting principles the figure might have been labeled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
“deficit” and would have been charged against the Post Office rather
than pinned on the airlines as a “subsidy.” After all, the Post Office
Department overhead, an item perhaps more political than economic
in character, was not subject to airline control and was therefore
the responsibility of the department. A subsidy is a public
grant or subvention to aid an enterprise for the public convenience
and not the deficit of a government department.</p>

<p>In the face of such fuzzy accounting the figure is interesting
chiefly because of its small size. The Postmaster General, after referring
to statistical exhibits, reported the total deficit incurred from
the inauguration of the first air-mail service in 1918 up to 1948 as
a little over three and one-half million dollars per year for the thirty-year
period and added, “Probably no investment made by this
government ever returned greater national benefits in commercial
and cultural progress, and national security. The over-all value of
air transportation system to the nation, particularly as an arm of
defense, has been incalculable.”</p>

<p>It is interesting in passing to compare the air-mail deficit with
others submitted by the Postmaster General: penny postcards,
$57,000,000; fourth-class mail, $82,000,000; third-class mail, $139,000,000;
and second-class mail, $237,000,000—a total of $515,000,000.
And so the air-mail deficit is but one of many and the least of
them all. On the basis of such approximations as have been presented
by government agencies, the airlines might have argued that
by absorbing a portion of the vast overhead of the Post Office Department
they were actually “subsidizing” other types of mail
service.</p>

<p>In light of the dearth of figures that would indicate an approximation
to the true air-mail subsidy, if any, Carleton Putnam, of
Chicago and Southern, made an exhaustive analysis of government
cost records, during which he checked his assumptions with responsible
persons in the government. This indicated that from the
inception of the air mail down to the year 1948, the postal revenues
had exceeded the added costs of air mail to the Post Office by some
$54,000,000. Summing up for the Committee, in a statement which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
was not challenged by the government, he testified, “Hence the
American taxpayer has not only gained the greatest air transportation
system on earth ... plus an adjunct to the national defense
which would otherwise have cost him untold millions to provide—he
is $54,000,000 ahead in cash as well.”</p>

<p>And after charging the airlines for their share of the cost of
building and maintaining the nation’s airways and airports, an expenditure
which would in any case have had to be made for the
Army and Navy, the airlines would still owe the taxpayer but
$61,000,000, all of which relates to maintaining the national airways
system. Furthermore this clear demonstration that the air
mail has not been subsidized comes in the face of grievous blunders
by the Civil Aeronautics Board in certifying uneconomic competing
services at extravagant mail rates.</p>

<p>One of the most extreme cases of this kind was reported by Captain
Eddie Rickenbacker. The Civil Aeronautics Board had in the past
two years certified twenty-one “feeder lines,” some of which had
been authorized to divert mail poundage from some stations which
Eastern had served for twenty years without subsidy, and to charge
ten times as much to transport the same mail between the same
points. In other words, the Civil Aeronautics Board, impelled by
some sense of political necessity to provide competition for the
major airlines, had in effect forced them to subsidize competition
for themselves. Meanwhile the government had paid such niggardly
rates to others that the stockholders of the enterprises had
been forced to subsidize the United States.</p>

<p>Such “reasonable” regulation had reduced the airlines from their
once proud state of self-sufficiency to a critical status, and at the
very moment when their futures should have looked the brightest.</p>

<p>“There can be little doubt,” stated the chairman of the Civil
Aeronautics Board, “that if our airline system were today the same
size as it was in 1941 in terms of routes, points served, and service
provided, it would be completely independent of government support.”
It was certain additions to the service, he further pointed out,
and the fixing of certain “fair” compensations by the Board that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
slowed all airlines save Eastern down to stalling speed and all but
put them into a flat spin. He shared his responsibility with the appropriation
committees of Congress and thought that if funds were
provided for an adequate staff the Board might do a competent
job. However the fact that the Civil Aeronautics Authority and
Civil Aeronautics Board already had 18,000 employees as compared
with approximately 80,000 employees for all domestic and overseas
scheduled airlines rather discounted this opinion.</p>

<p>That the damage did not end with heavy losses imposed by arbitrary
rates but was multiplied by the award of retroactive payments
is evidenced in the testimony of Roger F. Murray, vice-president of
the Bankers Trust Company of New York.</p>

<p>“The Board’s thinking,” he said, “has apparently been that rates
should be set so that <em>each</em> carrier will break even and perhaps earn
some so-called ‘fair’ rate of return on it’s ‘used and useful investment.’
Under these circumstances, enlarged payments have been
made to rescue some airlines in difficulties or keep others going on
a subsistence basis. While this may be reassuring to creditors of the
airlines, it is the poorest kind of an appeal to potential purchasers
of equity securities.”</p>

<p>Translating this into lay language, the private investor or his
agents just cannot be interested in buying stock in enterprises which
are suffering economic regulation by political agencies. And once
an enterprise is denied access to the highly competitive markets for
risk capital, it is indeed on the verge of bankruptcy or about to crash
into the abyss of nationalization. And if the government, after having
reduced the market value of the airlines by its own mismanagement,
then takes possession of them, it becomes guilty of expropriating
the capital of private investors, some of whom had risked their
savings in an enterprise they deemed secure because it was government
regulated.</p>

<p>Now mismanagement of the airlines was not necessarily the fault
of wicked or even stupid men. As Speaker Sam Rayburn had pointed
out to me in the case of Congressmen, government administrators
are no smarter nor more stupid than the average. But they hold their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
jobs by knowing which side their bread is buttered on and making
the correct estimate of what action will produce the most votes.</p>

<p>The Civil Aeronautics Board, in light of current public opinion
with respect to the profit motive, could hardly be expected to accept
public responsibility for such economic regulation as would
permit any airline to make a profit, especially one such as might
be subject to political attack. Nor could it be expected to muster
courage to defend such an apparent monopoly as its own route
pattern had created, even though the law authorized it. Although
the Board was directed to so administer the Act as to prevent “unfair
or destructive practices,” it must permit “competition to the
extent necessary to insure sound development of an air transportation
system properly adapted to the needs of the foreign and domestic
commerce of the United States, of the Postal Service, and the
national defense.” Its decisions, predicated on an attempt to administer
such complex mandates and still keep out of hot water,
brought the airlines into jeopardy at the very moment when they
had established their economic self-sufficiency and faced the brightest
futures of their turbulent careers. In other words, economic
regulation by political agency is an anachronism.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the real solution to the Board’s competition
problem ready at hand, the Board even messed that up. This drama
was unfolded before the Committee by a group of enterprising
young veterans who, having participated in such wartime miracles
as the transportation of air cargo over the Himalayan Hump, had
concluded that this and other services as yet unexploited by the
certificated passenger carriers offered unique opportunities for their
postwar reconversion. Perhaps the gist of their testimony can be extracted
from the statement of Amos E. Heacock, executive committee
chairman of the National Independent Carriers, and president
of Air Transport Associates.</p>

<p>“Let me review briefly,” he said, “the near miracles that have
been wrought in the development of air transportation by United
States veterans.... In the international contract air carrier field,
Transocean Airlines, Seaboard and Western, Pacific Overseas Airlines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
etc., have found an entirely new market for air transportation,
formerly practically untouched by the scheduled airlines....
I want to point out to you an additional and perhaps the greatest
air transportation feat performed by the veterans of World War
II. I am referring to the amazing record of the Pacific Northwest-Alaska
nonscheduled carriers.... The scheduled carriers that
were subsidized to do the job of developing air transportation to
Alaska were a miserable failure. The bulk of the cargo, 73.6 per
cent of the northbound and 83.5 per cent of the southbound, was
transported by the much maligned nonscheduled air carriers....
The records show that the non-skeds pioneered a wealth of new
business.”</p>

<p>After referring to Section 2(d) of the Act, which provides
for competition, the witness stated, “With an unprecedented opportunity
to preserve competition to develop the air transportation
system and so provide adequate and economical service, the Board’s
actions have provided for just the reverse.”</p>

<p>One explanation of the Board’s action might be derived from the
statement of C. R. Smith, chairman of American Airlines, one of
the largest of the “Big Four.”</p>

<p>“If the law of the land is to be enforced against the certificated
air carriers,” he said, “it should have similar enthusiasm of enforcement
against the irregular carriers who compete directly for the
same business of air transportation. We cannot live with economic
health in an atmosphere half legal and half illegal. If this business
is to be regulated, all should be regulated.” It would be interesting
to know just what significance attaches to the use of the word
“against” in this statement.</p>

<p>“If the Civil Aeronautics Act is to mean but little,” continued
“C.R.,” “then let us return to the rules of the road which obtained
before the Act was passed, when competition was direct and unregulated.”
Had “C.R.” gone on to urge this course, he might have
given a demonstration of the rugged individualism for which he
is credited; instead he summed up, “We were in favor of the Act,
we are in favor of the continuation of the Act, but if we are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
abide by the terms of the Act, we ask that our competitors be
bound by the same rules of public conduct.”</p>

<p>Juan Trippe, president of the Pan American Airways System,
stated the issue in similarly clear terms:</p>

<p>“The fundamental problem, both domestically and internationally,
is that although Congress intended to place the airline industry
in the category of regulated public utilities, the airlines, while
treated on one hand as public utilities, have, at the same time, been
made subject to all of the competitive pressures proper and appropriate
only in an unregulated industry. There is no precedent
in American industry that I know of for such a Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde arrangement.”</p>

<p>After developing the principles under which public utilities are
regulated and financed and suggesting that Congress should make
up its mind as to whether or not they want to return the airline
industry to its intended status as a regulated airline industry, Juan,
like “C.R.,” mentioned the alternative of eliminating the relative
provisions of the Civil Aeronautics Act and exposing the airlines
to the full competitive force which exists and should exist in ordinary
commerce.</p>

<p>“There will be no real progress in the solution of the airline problems,”
he summed up, “until this issue is met squarely. An airline
can’t be a regulated public utility and a free enterprise at the same
time.”</p>

<p>However, the witness did not waste further time on this alternative
but, acting on the assumption that the doctrine of regulating the
airlines as a public utility would be preserved, went on to develop
his own case with all the unique persuasiveness that had helped him
pioneer Pan American in one of the most impressive displays of
self-reliance, individual initiative, and private enterprise of modern
times. His discussion led up naturally to the merger of Pan American
with American Overseas Airlines which he and “C.R.” had
earlier submitted to the Civil Aeronautics Board. In justifying this,
Juan expounded his well-known thesis of the “chosen instrument”
advocating a government policy of maintaining one American-flag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
system—Pan American Airways—in the international field,
supported with frank outright subsidies such as those paid under
the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. He justified his position by citing
its benefits to the stockholders of the company and argued that the
higher wages thus made available to American workmen employed
in international aviation would constitute a subsidy to them.</p>

<p>With the major certificated airlines mobilized solidly in support
of the “chosen instrument” policy, the Committee received a clear
statement of the opposing point of view from Raymond A. Norden,
president of Seaboard and Western Airlines, Inc. One of the independents
who had been characterized by Captain Eddie Rickenbacker
as “irregulars,” “latecomers,” “interlopers,” “pretenders,”
and so forth, Mr. Norden undertook to support Eddie’s contention
that the airlines were suffering from too much coddling. In perhaps
the outstanding statement to be made to the Committee, he put his
finger on the crux of the airline controversy.</p>

<p>“The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938,” he said, “is unusual among
regulatory statutes in one very important respect. Other forms of
transportation have not customarily been subjected to comprehensive
regulation until the pattern of growth has been assured and
until the industry has become so highly developed competitively
that there is need for rigid controls and restraints in order to prevent
destructive practices.” Out of the background of the airplane
story to date, one might argue the other way around, namely that
once the rigid controls and restraints are imposed, the growth pattern
becomes stabilized. Mr. Norden went on to argue with persuasion:</p>

<p>“Aviation is relatively a new business. Air freight, as distinguished
from other forms of aviation business, is in its infancy. Yet the entire
aviation industry is hedged about with red tape, the like of which
has never been encountered in any other form of American industry.
One has merely to look at legal payments made by some of the
certificated carriers. TWA, for example, in 1948 alone, paid a single
law firm the sum of $340,000. My own small company spent in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
excess of $50,000 in legal expense. Sometimes I feel as though I had
more lawyers than pilots.”</p>

<p>When the Russians blockaded Berlin in June, 1948, according to
the witness, the Air Force, lacking reserve planes, called upon three
certificated, subsidized North Atlantic carriers, Pan American,
TWA, and American Overseas Airlines, to lift essential material between
this country and Germany. Those carriers failed miserably; of
the three irregular international carriers called upon to assist, Seaboard
and Western lifted more than twice as much tonnage over the
North Atlantic in the next six months as Pan American, TWA, and
American Overseas combined. Yet under pressure from the certificated
carriers, the Civil Aeronautics Board revoked Seaboard’s authority
to fly under its Letter of Registration, as of May 20, 1949,
along with all other large irregular airlines in this country. In his
indictment of the certificated carriers the witness said, “In their zeal
to keep the air transportation field to themselves and to obviate the
chance that a measurement will be set up against their operational
efficiency, the North Atlantic carriers are doing a great disservice
to the country. To put it bluntly, they are sabotaging the development
of airlift which is vital to national security.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norden then went on to quote from an article by J. A. Durham
and M. J. Feldstein in the <cite>Virginia Law Review</cite> entitled
“Regulation as a Tool in the Development of the Air Freight Industry”:</p>

<p>“But where an agency is charged with creating new national
wealth by developing an infant industry, the consequence of permitting
established interests to employ the forms of justice to obstruct
the attainment of statutory objectives may well destroy the
value of the administrative process.”</p>

<p>A less reasoned but even more revealing statement was that of
Charles F. Willis, Jr., president of Willis Air Service, Inc., one of
the “irregulars”:</p>

<p>“Consequently it is with great bitterness that we have seen ourselves
singled out by the Civil Aeronautics Board for denial of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
certificate of public convenience and necessity.... It is even
harder to accept the decision because the only reason we are given
for it is that we don’t have a million dollars. We never had a million
dollars and we never needed a million dollars to perform our
operations, but we do have almost all the dollars we started with. We
feel that we have successfully demonstrated that an airline can be
kept going, at a profit, if hard work, ingenuity, and a desire to make
a profit are substituted for lavish spending of other people’s money.”</p>

<p>In such a sketchy review of the reams of testimony submitted to
the Committee it is quite impossible to do more than attempt to summarize
the major points of view and try to pan out the nuggets that
reveal the vital issues. After sluicing away the rubble and uncovering
bed rock, my own impression is largely one of intense sympathy
for the Civil Aeronautics Board. Charged with an almost impossible
task, it has been subjected to terrific forces by organizations skilled
in the art of influencing public opinion. I also come away with a
feeling of regret that airline management could not have approached
the problem under the precepts adopted by the Aircraft Industries
Association.</p>

<p>Most American early birds will recall with a nostalgic smile a
cartoon that once adorned the walls of many a pioneer flight school.
Entitled “His First Solo,” it depicted a forlorn fledgling perched out
on the end of a bare limb. Near its root poised an impatient mother
bird from whose beak floated the command, “Come on, kid! Give
’er the gun!”</p>

<p>One day, while studying the conflicting testimony of airline
operators in an endeavor to predict the next twist of the slipstream,
I recalled this early masterpiece of contemporary art. The fledgling
on the end of the limb seemed now to have feathered out; he appeared,
in fact, almost overgrown. The mother bird cocked her
head questioningly, “I wonder if he’s got what it takes?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From the days of Wilbur and Orville Wright on down to the
present, aviators have groped for an understanding of the airplane’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
destiny. Charles A. Lindbergh, in his book <cite>Of Flight and Life</cite>, has
stated the problem:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The tragedy of scientific man is that he has found no way to
guide his own discoveries to a constructive end. He has guarded
none so carefully that his enemies have not eventually obtained
it and turned it against him. He has developed a system in
which his security today and tomorrow seems to depend on
building weapons which will destroy him the day after. He
has become so hypnotized by his search for knowledge that
he must go on discovering and experimenting even though
it leads to his own annihilation. With the key to science he
has turned loose forces which he cannot re-imprison.</p>
</div>

<p>In the closing paragraph of his book Lindbergh states, “Our
salvation, and our only salvation, lies in controlling the arm of
western science by the eternal truths of God.”</p>

<p>Igor I. Sikorsky, in <cite>The Invisible Encounter</cite>, goes back two thousand
years for his solution. In a chapter called “Kingdoms of the
World,” he quotes from the Gospel according to Matthew: “Again
the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and
sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them
and saith unto Him. All these things will I give Thee, if thou wilt
fall down and worship me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sikorsky then goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The crown and recognition as Messiah the king were offered
to Christ. But He refused to accept them. However, He offered
his spiritual leadership to the whole Jewish nation but
his offer was disregarded.... The real cause of the tragedy
was the irreconcilable conflict between the Divine ideology
of Christ and the supremely evil spirit of the impending revolution.</p>
</div>

<p>After drawing an apt parallel in current history, Mr. Sikorsky
remarks, “If the world is to be controlled by spiritually dead men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
it is as if an unconscious crew were placed at the controls of an airliner.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Civilization stands today at the same crossroad. It need but accept
the proffered leadership to commence an era of spiritual and material
progress such as it has not yet known.</p>

<p>A single characteristic differentiates America from all other lands.
Ours is a nation created by God-fearing men and women in search
of liberty. Liberty is a force more explosive than atomic bombs. It
created America. America stands today both as God’s living proof
of the power of human freedom and as the negation of conflicting
human doctrine.</p>

<p>As we have seen from the record, the airplane is one of the miraculous
creations of liberty. No result of human foresight or planning,
it is a Divine revelation. And though, as yet, largely prostituted to
the folly of war, it embodies in itself the potential of world peace
and freedom.</p>

<p>For always the hand on the stick has been the Hand of God. The
Berlin Airlift, hastily improvised amid the rubble of war, contrived
out of dire necessity, uncertainty, and fear, gave the world an
American answer to that eternal question, “Am I my brother’s
keeper?” The unequivocal answer came, not in a rain of destruction
but on a flood of life-giving necessities.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am his keeper. I am the keeper of the peace!”</p>

<p>The triumph of the airlift was not one of men and machines but
of the Christian spirit.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
